5| Copy page: Click on icon "Copy page." Your copied page will be inserted
underneath the highlighted element.|

  
  
  
6| Import page: Click on "Import page." Then click on "Select file" before
selecting a HTML page. Click on "Import."|  
  
7| Delete page: Click on icon "Delete page" and confirm.|  
  
  
Now you can insert more pages following the same pattern. More information on
the available editor features can be found in the **[CP
Editor](CP+Editor.html)** chapter.

You can import several HTML pages at once by zipping them before uploading the
resulting ZIP file.

Click on the icon "Preview" on your top right in the toolbar to have a look at
your CP before saving it.

Step 4: Save CP  
---  
1| Click on "Save" in the lower center.  
2| Close CP tab and navigate back to your course.  
  
  

Now go back to your OpenOlat course.

Step 5: Publish and activate your course  
---  
1| Select "Publish" in the toolbar on top.|

2| Check course element and then go "Next."  
3| Select "All registered OpenOlat users" from the pull-down menu in
"Modification of course access."  
4| Click on "Finish."  
  
The CP is now embedded in your course and course participants can read its
content. In order to edit this CP just click on "Edit" in the tab "Learning
content."

Under " **Display** " you can determine whether the CP's own component menu
should be integrate into course navigation.

In the tab " **Layout** " you define the settings for the display of the CP.
The setting options are identical to those of a [single
page](Course+Element%EF%B9%95+Single+Page.html#CourseElement%3ASinglePage-
_splayout).

  

Alternatively, a CP can be created just like any other learning resource in
the author area and then integrated into the desired course. This procedure is
recommended to understand that learning resources are cross-course tools and
that integration into the selected course is only one possibility. The same CP
can be integrated and used in several OLAT courses.
