# Technology and Navigation

OpenOlat is a web application and is mostly written in Java. Furthermore we
use standard web applications such as: Apache (web server), Tomcat
(application server), a MySQL data base (other data bases are also possible),
and XML (data management). Intuitive user interfaces are implemented using Web
2.0 technologies. Files can be uploaded by drag&drop.

OpenOlat received a responsive design to accomodate users with mobile devices.
OpenOlat is fully functional on mobile devices, layout and organization of
page content adapt to display size and orientation. Order and arrangement of
menus and content is dependent on the window size OpenOlat is displayed in.
