## What to Expect From this Manual

This user manual helps you to make yourself familiar with OpenOlat while
thoroughly explaining it's functionality.

The OpenOlat manual is meant for people interested in e-learning as well as in
making use of OpenOlat for various reasons. If you have not worked with
OpenOlat (former OLAT) before you will get more information on how to get
started with this learning platform step by step which includes searching for
predefined learning content, its adaption, as well as the handling of
collaborative tools.

Perhaps you were already an experienced OLAT user but now you want to provide
others with learning content in OpenOlat. In this case the chapters on
learning resources, course elements, course editor and the ones on how to
create courses or tests will assist you in your work.

If you were already an OLAT expert this manual will serve as a work of
reference. Its table of contents is there to guide you; the PDF version
additionally provides an index in order to find what you are looking for as
fast as possible.
