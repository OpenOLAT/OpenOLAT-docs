## Guest Access

You can use OpenOlat as guest as well. The so-called guest access provides an
insight into OpenOlat with limited access to certain features: you will only
get to learning content that is explicitly open to the public. In order to
have access to other material and activities you will have to register first.
Further information to the guest access can be found
[here](../general/Guest_access.md).

## Browser Check {: #browsercheck}
