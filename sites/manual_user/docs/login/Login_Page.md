## Guest Access

You can use OpenOlat as guest as well. The so-called guest access provides an
insight into OpenOlat with limited access to certain features: you will only
get to learning content that is explicitly open to the public. In order to
have access to other material and activities you will have to register first.
Further information to the guest access can be found
[here](../general/Guest_access.md).

## Browser Check {: #browsercheck}

OpenOlat is optimized for the following browser software:

  * [Firefox 53](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) or later version (from version 45 on)
  * [Google Chrome 58](http://www.google.com/chrome/) or later version (recommended) (from version 50 on)
  * [Apple Safari 10](http://www.apple.com/safari/) or later version (from version 9 on)

Internet Explorer in version 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 by Microsoft is not fully
supported anymore. Microsoft dropped support for these versions, and security
updates are no longer provided for. Should you use an older browser which is
not supported anymore the corresponding warning will be shown by the login.
They you can use OpenOlat at your own risk or update your browser. This
warning can be hidden through CSS by your system administrator.
