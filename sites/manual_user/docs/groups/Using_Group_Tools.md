	In a group calendar, the group participants can see all the entries of the group members, regardless of whether the appointments are private or public.
	
	If the group is assigned to a course, the following entries are displayed to the group participants in the course calendar:

	- public entries of the group,
	- the respective group members own group calendar entries,
	- as well as course specific calendar entries. 
	
	People who are not members of the group will not see the calendar entries of the other groups in the course calendar. If several groups are assigned to a course, the members will only see their own group calendar entries, but not those of the other groups.
