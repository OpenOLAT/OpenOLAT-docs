OpenOlat works with a comprehensive group system which allows to configure
groups as desired in order to meet different requirements. OpenOlat users can
see their groups whenever they click on "Groups" in the main navigation. Here,
both your own groups (my groups) and the published groups are displayed in the
corresponding menus. Further filtering by favorites or by role is also
possible. For further configuration, simply expand the filter area using the
small arrow.

All groups you are a member of are always accessible under "Groups" in the "My
Groups" tab.

All OpenOlat users can create groups on his own to invite any number of other
OpenOlat users. This function may be turned off by the administrator of your
OpenOlat system. Groups can be linked to a number of courses and vice versa,
if so desired. In this way, groups can be used for group work in courses and
also for rights management.

This chapter further explains the different configuration settings and
illustrates how to configure groups for various purposes.
