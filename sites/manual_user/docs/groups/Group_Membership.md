# Become a group member {: #group_membership}


There are basically 3 ways to become a group member in OpenOlat:

* You can be invited to an OpenOlat group by coaches and other authorized persons and made a member,
* Your group membership can be created automatically,
* or you can register yourself as a group member.

The way in which you can become a group member depends on which group it is and how the group is configured by the creator.

### How do you make someone a group member in several groups at the same time? {: #add_several_groupmembers}

**Step 1:**<br>
Navigate to the desired group via the main menu.

**Step 2:**<br>
Select the checkboxes in front of all groups to which the person is to be added. Make sure that you yourself are a member of all selected groups as a coach.

![group_membership_select_several_groups_v1_de.png](assets/group_membership_select_several_groups_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

**Step 3:**<br>
As soon as at least one checkbox is selected, the "Manage accounts" button appears above the list. If you click this button, a pop-up opens in which the members of all selected groups are listed together. Use the two buttons to add further participants and coaches to all selected groups.

![group_membership_add_several_members_v1_de.png](assets/group_membership_add_several_members_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

**Step 4:**<br>
The group membership of members who have been added several times at the same time may still need to be confirmed. If you look in the member administration in one of the courses, you may find a corresponding note. Whether such confirmation is required by the new group members can be specified by the administrator.

## Automatically created group memberships {: #add_groupmembers_automatically}

If certain people are already grouped together in another system (e.g. HR software), these group memberships can also be mapped in OpenOlat. However, this requires middleware (Syncher), which can then automatically assign users to specific OpenOlat groups.

If you have any questions about automatically assigned group membership, please contact frentix.

## Assign yourself as a group member {: #by_yourself}

### Groups in course element "Enrolment" {: #add_groupmembership_in_course_element_enrolment}

If authors use the [course element “Enrolment”](../learningresources/Course_Element_Enrolment.md), learning groups can be created there that are initially without participants. When the course is active, they can then register themselves as members of one (or more) of the groups offered.

**Where can users find offers for groups?**<br>
Users can find groups with offers under **"Published groups"**. Click on **"Join"** to book an offer and become a group member.

### Overbooking {: #overbooking}

If the group size has been limited, participants who wish to join a group in which all places are already taken can be placed on a waiting list. (See [Create groups >](Create_Groups.md#foreseen-number-of-participants)).

In the event of overbooking, corresponding notices appear, e.g:

![group_membership_overbooking1_v1_de.png](assets/group_membership_overbooking1_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

## Founding a group {: #found_a_group}

### Who can create a group?

Administrators can define system-wide in **Administration > Modules > Groups** whether the creation of new groups is permitted for course authors and/or participants.

### Creating a group

If you have been granted this permission, you will also find the "Create group" button under the "Groups" menu item in the main menu. 
[More about creating groups >](Create_Groups.md)

![group_membership_create_group_v1_de.png](assets/group_membership_create_group_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }


### Add members to my group

If you create a group, you automatically become the group administrator. In this role, you will have the "Administration" menu option for your group. There you can add further people (make them group members) and configure the rights of group members in the "Members" tab.
