## Folder in the personal menu

Under "Personal tools" all OpenOlat users have access to their
personal folders. In this folder you
can find 2 subfolders, the folders  "private"  and  "public".

 _Private_

Every user can upload every supported file here. This folder can be used as
temporary storage and to get access to files from different servers. Here
OpenOlat works like a cloud.

Additionally, that data, which is downloaded in the data archiving, is saved
here as well.

 _Public_

Files, which should be available for other OpenOlat users, can be stored in this
folder. The public folder is visible in the user's business card. In the
personal tools in Other users you can search for the user who uploaded a file
for you. This simplifies the data exchange between OpenOlat users.



## General Information about folders

Folders are used to store documents, make files available for download or exchange files with other users. 

If you have read **and** write permissions, which must first be assigned to you in courses or groups by the relevant coach, you can upload, create, copy, move and delete files in these folders. You automatically have read and write permissions in the personal folders.

File names of files you wish to upload to OpenOlat should contain only the following:

a-z, A-Z, 0-9, as well as "-", ".", "_" or space

Additionally you can zip or unzip files. All these actions can be performed
with single files and folders or with several ones at once. If you want to
upload many files at once there are two options at your disposal.

On the one hand, you can zip your files on your computer, upload the ZIP file and unzip it in the OpenOlat folder. You can also transfer and organize multiple files via WebDAV. All folders are WebDAV-capable, i.e. folders in OpenOlat are available to you as a normal network drive, which you can use to copy, move and delete files very easily. Further information can be found in the chapter "[Using WebDAV](../basic_concepts/Using_WebDAV.md)".

!!! info "Note"

    In order for the WebDAV access to work, it needs to be activated by your OpenOlat administrator first.

## Quota

The storage space per folder is limited. The administrator determines the
available storage space. The default setting for the private
and public folders is 100 MB. To increase this quota
your respective OpenOlat support center. Please contact
the responsible contact person if necessary.

## Other types of folders
