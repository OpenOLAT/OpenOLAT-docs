If credit points are awarded in courses, you will be credited with credit points after successfully completing a course.

The credit points can be credited to you in different "currencies." Which "currencies" (credit point systems) are available in the system can be determined by administrators.

You can find your current account balance in your personal menu.

## Credit points as a prerequisite for course participation

Certificate programs may require that you have a certain number of credits in your account before you can be admitted to a course. 

Please note that credit points can be awarded in different "currencies" (credit point systems). 

**Example**<br>
For example, it can be set up so that you can earn "safety points" (the currency of OpenOlat credit points) in various Level 1 safety training courses. A credit balance of 50 "safety points" may be required for admission to a Level 2 safety training course. Other credit points are not recognized for this training course.
