The personal configurations can be found as a section in the [personal menu](index.md), below the personal tools.

Which configuration tools are offered to you here is determined on the one hand by the default settings/activation in the system administration. On the other hand, you can decide whether the tools should appear in the [personal menu](../index.md) or in the quick access in the header.
