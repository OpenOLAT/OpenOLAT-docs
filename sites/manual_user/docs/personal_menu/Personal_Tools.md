![pers_menu_tools_v1_de.png](assets/pers_menu_tools_v1_de.png){ class="aside-right shadow lightbox"}

You can find the personal Tools as a section in the [Personal Menu](index.md).

Which tools are offered to you here is determined on the one hand by the default settings/activation in the system administration. On the other hand, you can decide whether the tools should appear in the [personal menu](index.md) or in the quick access in the header.

## Calendar
  
In the personal calendar, you can see your private appointments as well as entries from group and course calendars that have been added to your personal calendar via the calendar list.

##  Personal folder (up to Release 18)

OpenOlat provides you with storage space in your personal folder. For example, you can store presentations there that you want to access from another computer, cache research papers, etc.

Find out [more >](../personal_menu/Personal_folders.md)

## File Hub (Release 19)

From Release 19, a file hub is available in OpenOlat in which all folders available in OpenOlat are listed. (Course folders, group folders, archive folders, etc.) However, only folders to which the logged-in user has access authorization are displayed in the File Hub. The **personal folder** can also be accessed via the File Hub.

For this reason, "Personal Folder" has been replaced by "File Hub" in the selection options for personal tools from Release 19.

##  Notes

##  Evidences of achievement

A certificate of achievement is a confirmation of a completed performance assessment and shows, for example, completed tests or submitted and assessed tasks. Course authors specify in their courses whether OpenOlat should create certificates of achievement. Course participants see their transcripts of records if they are attending courses with transcripts of records, have already performed and have been assessed. 

Certificates are a special form of proof of performance.
