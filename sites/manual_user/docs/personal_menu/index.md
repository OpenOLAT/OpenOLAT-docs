# :material-home: Personal menu and general components

After your login you will navigate either to your personal homepage in
OpenOlat, an info page, a page which usually contains general information on
various topics, to the portal or a landing page defined by you. This chapter
will inform you on how to change the settings in your personal menu, on how to
use further features like the full text search and the chat and on how to
adapt the portal to your personal needs. If you cannot see the portal it was
most probably disabled by the system administrator.
