# E-Mail

![mail icon](assets/contact.png)

OpenOlat has an internal e-mail module that enables you to send mails from
various points. If the OpenOlat inbox system is disabled, all OLAT e-mails
will be sent exclusively to the respective personal e-mail address.

You can send e-mails with open body from various instances

  * in the course ([course elements Mail](../course_elements/Administration_and_Organisation.md), [Participant list](../learning_activities/Working_With_Course_Elements.md))
  * in the course [toolbar](../course_operation/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md)
  * via [course reminders](../course_operation/Course_Reminders.md)
  * invitations for courses or groups
  * via visiting card
  * using the [group tool Mail](../groups/Group_Administration.md)
  * in the [members management](../course_operation/Members_management.md) of learning resources and groups.
