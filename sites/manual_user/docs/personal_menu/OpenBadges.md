Badges in your personal menu are your place for all your earned badges, whether they are awarded through a course or from a person or institution.

Clicking onto the Badge opens up the Info Site with further information. 

## Badge info page

Here you can find out when and by whom the badge was awarded and you get information about the award context. A description and especially the award criteria assigned by the creator of the badge contain further important information.

The badge info page can be shared via the listed public link and included in other web contexts. This allows people to access the badge info page even without an OpenOlat account.
