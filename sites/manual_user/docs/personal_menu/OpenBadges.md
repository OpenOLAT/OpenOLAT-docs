“Badges” in your personal menu are the place where you can store and view all the badges you have earned, regardless of how and where they were awarded in OpenOlat.

Central information about each badge is displayed, and individual badges can be downloaded and added to LinkedIn.

If you click on a badge you have received, you will be taken to the badge information page with further information.

## Badge info page

Here you can find out when and by whom the badge was awarded and information on the award context. A description and, in particular, the award criteria assigned by the creator of the badge contain further important information.

The badge info page can be shared via the listed public link and integrated into other web contexts. This means that people can also access the badge info page without an OpenOlat account.
