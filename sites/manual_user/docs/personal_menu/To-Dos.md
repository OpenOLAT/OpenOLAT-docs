# To-Dos

The tasks to be done (To-Dos) can be found in several places in OpenOlat (e.g. within a project). <br> In the personal menu you will find all your **personal** to-dos summarized in an **overview**.

You can

* create new to-dos (1)
* View your to-dos sorted by status (2)
* click on the small arrow at the beginning of the line to open the details of a to-do (3)
* edit the to-dos (4)
* Delete to-dos (after selecting a to-do in the first column, the delete button is displayed) (5)

    If you prefer to have your to-dos displayed in the header instead of the personal menu, you can move the menu option from the personal menu to there. You make the setting for this under<br>
    **Personal Menu > Setting > System tab > Personal tools section**<br>
    All tools that you mark here are displayed in the header at the top right instead of in the personal menu and can thus be accessed more quickly.
