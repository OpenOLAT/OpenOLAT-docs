In contrast to the general full-text search, which can be called up under the magnifying glass symbol in the header, the search function in the personal menu is a **person search**. The search form contains the corresponding fields with which the search can be narrowed down. 

The search fields available may vary depending on the role.

    At least one term must be entered to narrow it down.<br>
    In addition, the search term must have a certain minimum length.
