# My entries

In "My entries" all entries are listed in a chronological order. Therefore it
doesn't matter in which binder an entry is located. You've got a summary about
all your entries and with the help of the status you can see their progress.
One entry can contain several contents or artefacts.

Particular [contents](My+portfolio+binders.html#Myportfoliobinders-
portfolioinhalt) of an entry are added to the media center, depending on their
type. There they can be edited as well. Entries are not added to the media
center.
