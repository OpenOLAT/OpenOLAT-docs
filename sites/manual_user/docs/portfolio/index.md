# Creating Portfolios

![](assets/portfolio_434343_64.png) With
e-portfolios learners are able to arrange, reflect and document their learning
and development processes. In the Portfolio 2.0 of OpenOlat different types
can be implemented. As far as the access rights are given by the
administrator, every OpenOlat user can
[create](Three_steps_to_your_portfolio_binder.md) a own portfolio (binder)
of any type. Specifically it is aligned to the [assessment
portfolio](Process_of_an_assessment_portfolio.md). Therefore a [portfolio
template](Portfolio_template_Creation.md) with assignments is
created be the author which can be
[edited](Portfolio+template%EF%B9%95+Administration+and+editing.html) by the
users afterward.

The following chapter explains how to use the Portfolio 2.0. On the one hand
it supports the authors in creating the portfolio template, on the other hand
it helps the users in solving portfolio assignments and [creating own
portfolios](Three+steps+to+your+portfolio+binder.html).
