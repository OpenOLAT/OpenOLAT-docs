Hint

To grade a Portfolio with a score it has to be integrated in the course
element "Portfolio task". Also the option "Score granted" in the tab
"Assessment" of this course element has to be enabled.

After adding the course element and linking the "portfolio 2.0 template" the
complete course must be published. You can choose fast publishing by simply
closing the course editor or follow the steps of the publishing wizard by
clicking on the option "Publish".

The Portfolio 2.0 template is now available in the course and the course
participants can collect the portfolio task to edit it.

The portfolio template is now embedded and the participants can collect the
