Every OpenOlat user can create his own portfolio folders independent of a
course or author rights.

A binder consist of sections, entries and contents. Here it is shown step by
step how a binder is created.

2. Click on the icon "Create new binder". If using the option below you can
choose between an empty binder and a portfolio binder template or you can use
a portfolio task from a course.  
  
3. If choosing an empty binder you can add a title and a summary and also upload
a teaser image. The text of the summary appears on the overview page of the
folder and can also be changed later via "Edit metadata". If choosing a binder
from template or from course portfolio task you are not able to do so.
