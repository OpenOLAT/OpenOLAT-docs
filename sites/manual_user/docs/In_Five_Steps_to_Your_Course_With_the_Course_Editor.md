#  [In Five Steps to Your Course With the Course
Editor](In+Five+Steps+to+Your+Course+With+the+Course+Editor.html)

In the course editor you can add [course
elements](Types+of+Course+Element.html) to the course and set up and modify
already installed course elements. The following describes how to create a
course without using a wizard.

In the first step you create your course. In the following steps, you add the
desired course elements.

Step 1: Create course  
---  
1| Click on "Authoring" in the main navigation.|

2|

Click on the button "Create" and choose "Course".

  
  
  
3| Insert title and click "Create".|

![](../../download/attachments/590936/settings_16.png)  
  
4| Select course type (conventional course or [learning path
course](Learning+path+course.html)) and confirm with "Create".  
5|

You can now make further settings in the menu that appears.

Add the description and further information in the tab "Info". Use the
"Metadata" and "Execution" tabs for more information.

Also use the tabs "Metadata" e.g. for a license specification and "Execution"
for the specification of an execution period.

Of course, you can also set up the other tabs now or add all information at a
later time.

  
  
  
6|

Start course editor from the "administration" in the toolbar.

The function "Insert course elements" opens a selection window with all
available course elements that you can add to your course.  
  
The exact further design and the choice of the [course
elements](Types+of+Course+Element.html) required depend on your didactic
concept. The following is _an example_ of a course similar to the course
wizard.

  

The following is an _example_ of how to recreate a course similar to the
course wizard.

## In the course editor

Open the "Course Editor" that can be found in the "Administration" section.  

  

Step 2: Insert welcome page  
---  
1| Click "Insert course elements" in the course toolbar and select "Single
page" in the knowledge transfer section. A new course element is always
inserted right beneath the currently selected course element.|

![](../../download/attachments/590936/insert_course_elements16.png)  
  
2| Indicate a short title in the tab "Title and description" and save your
settings.  
3| In the tab "Page content" click on "Create page and open in editor". This
is how you get to the OpenOlat HTML editor.|

![](../../download/attachments/590936/Singel_page_content.png)  
  
4|

Enter the desired content here, e.g. a welcome text.  
  
5| Click on "Save and close".  
  
|  
  
  
Alternatively, you can use an existing HTML or PDF page and upload or link to
it. To do this, select the "Select page" button in step 3. If your file is
already in the course's storage folder select the option "Select file" in the
submenu that will appear. If you want to upload a file on your computer and
link it to your course select the option "Upload file".

  

Wenn Sie keine HTM-Seite für die Inhalte verwenden möchten, können sie
alternativ auch den Kursbaustein "Dokument" verwenden.

Step 3: Insert folder for courseware before uploading documents from your
computer  
---  
1| Click "Insert course elements" in the course toolbar and select "Folder" in
the knowledge transfer section. A new course element is always inserted right
beneath the currently selected course element.  
2| Indicate a short title in the tab "Title and description" and save your
settings.  
3|

In the tab "Folder Configuration" either use an automatically generated folder
or select the course's storage folder to define the storage location for the
folder's files.  
  
4|

Then you can upload your files to the defined folder via "Manage folder".  
  
5| Select the link "Upload file" and search for the desired file on your own
computer. Finish the process by clicking the "Upload" button.  
  
  
  
There are generally several possibilities and ways to provide course
materials. Have a look at the other course elements from the knowledge
transfer section. In addition, you can also activate a folder in the toolbar
(here under the designation "Documents"). This way the folder is continuously
available.

  

  

Step 4: Insert discussion forum  
---  
1| Click "Insert course elements" in the course toolbar and select "Forum" in
the communication and collaboration section. A new course element is always
inserted right beneath the currently selected course element.  
2| Indicate a short title in the tab "Title and description" and save your
settings.  
  
Bei Bedarf können Sie noch im Tab "Konfiguration" definieren, ob auch
pseudonymisierte Forenbeiträge erlaubt sind.

Adding further course elements follows the same principle.

  

### Simple design option: course element Tab Layout

All course elements have the tab "Layout". Here you have further visual design
options for the course elements. For example, you can store a background image
or choose a certain display style. Color coding is also possible. The preview
option allows you to see the effects directly. In this tab, you also determine
whether the course element is displayed with the stored short title the (long)
title or without title.  Here is an example:

Step 5: Publish  
---  
1|

Close the editor by selecting the original course path in the bread crumb
navigation. Alternatively, the course can be closed by clicking on the right
cross.

![](../../download/attachments/590936/publizieren_engl.png)  
  
2|

Select "Yes automatically" in the pop-up that appears.

![](../../download/attachments/590936/publish.png)  
  
Alternatively, you can also use the "Publish" link in the course editor. Here
you can find further configuration options.

Step 6: Configure share  
  
---  
1| Click the "Settings" menu in the "Administration" of the course.|

![](../../download/attachments/590936/Freigabe_konfigurieren_engl.png)  
  
  
2| Select the tab "Share" here.  
3|

Configure the access for the participants here and decide whether the
participants can book the course, whether you want to enter the participants
or whether the access should be open in general. You can find further details
on access configuration [here](Access+configuration.html).  
  
4|

To make the course visible and accessible to learners, the status must be
changed from "Preparation" to "Published".

|

  
  
  
  

Now your course is visible for OpenOlat users and can be used.

To ensure that your course is found by the learners, we recommend that you
enter the completed course in the [catalogue](Courses+and+Catalog.html). This
setting can be found in the menu "Preferences," tab "Catalog". Course
participants will then find your course under "Courses" → "Catalog" in the
corresponding category.

Many of the central elements of a course that should be permanently available
can also be inserted in the toolbar instead of in the left course navigation.
In this case, instead of the course elements in the course editor, the
appropriate tools are simply activated in the toolbar. In each case, consider
which variant is more suitable for your scenario.
