# Question rules

Question rules (working name: "Branching") can now be integrated in OpenOlat
in the [questionnaire

sites/manual_user/docs/forms/Question_rules.md §Form_editor_(Questionnaire_editor).md§ 481
editor](../../pages/viewpage.action%EF%B9%96pageId=108600747.html). Depending
on certain answers in the question container
"![](assets/image2021-5-5_9-32-45.png)multiple
choice" and
"![](assets/image2021-5-5_9-31-51.png)single
choice", actions can be executed.

Currently it is only possible to display certain question containers. Thus,
different question strings can be built.

## Creation of a rule

To create a question rule, these conditions must have been met:

  * Multiple selection/single selection with at least 1 answer.
  * A container that has a different question module or content and not the question modules mentioned above.

If the conditions are not met, a warning will be issued and you will not be
able to create a rule.

The container can be named for better understanding. Without own naming this
contains the default name <Unnamed>[Container ID].

Several levels

Due to the nesting of containers, it can quickly become confusing. It is
recommended not to use more than 2 nested containers with question rules.
