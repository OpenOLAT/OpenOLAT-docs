# Three steps to your form

Here you will learn how to create a form for different purposes, set it up and include it in a course.

## Step 1: Create learning resource form

1. In the [Authoring Area](../authoring/index.md) click on the link "Create" and select the learning resource "Form ".
2. Enter a title for the form.
3. The menu "[Settings](../course_create/Course_Settings.md)" of the administration appears. Here you can optionally make further settings immediately or later, e.g. store a license.

!!! info "Note"

    If you want to use the [Form in Courses](Forms_in_Courses.md)you don't need to submit the tab "Release" of the learning resource Form. Setting up the tab "Release" is primarily relevant if you want to use the learning resource stand-alone.

!!! tip "Tip"

    Since the learning resource form can be used in many different ways, it makes sense to consider the later use of the learning resource already when assigning the title, e.g. by prefixing it with a suitable abbreviation. This makes it easier to find and assign the form later.

## Step 2: Design + finalize form

1. In the "administration" of the learning resource choose form > "edit content" and you will get to the [form editor](../forms/Form_editor_Questionnaire_editor.md)
2. "Neu Layout hinzufügen: Wählen Sie eine der angezeigten Grundstrukturen für Ihr Formular. Das Formular wird in die entsprechend gekennzeichneten Bereiche aufgeteilt indem Sie im nächsten Schritt verschiedene Inhalte hinzufügen können.
3. choose "Add content" and select the desired element. It is best to start with a "Title" and add a short introductory text with the "Paragraph" element to inform the users accordingly.

    To add the next element select "Add content" again.  Alternativ können sie auch bei einem hinzugefügten Inhalt auf die 3-Punkte Option klicken und dann davor oder danach hinzufügen wählen. You will see the selection of all elements again.  

4. Next, select the desired question types and any organizational elements.  Save your settings in each case, if selectable. 

5. Repeat the process until the form is complete. If you want to use recurring elements, you can simply duplicate them. If you want to change the order of the elements, you can simply drag and drop them.

6. When you are done, close the editor by clicking on the title of the form in the crumb navigation. The form is now saved and you can see the form from a user's perspective.

Depending on the type of question you want to create, select "Rubric", "Single selection", "Multiple selection", "Upload file" or "Text input".

For more details on how to use the Form Editor, see the "[Form Editor"](../forms/Form_editor_Questionnaire_editor.md) chapter.

## Step 3: Embed form directly in course

1. go to the [author area](../authoring/index.md). In the area "My courses as well as under "My entries" and if necessary under "Favorites" you will find your courses. Start the course in which the form is to be integrated.

2. Open the "[Course editor](../course_create/In_Five_Steps_to_Your_Course_With_the_Course_Editor.md)" via "Administration".
   
    Select "Insert course elements" and click on the desired [course element](../course_elements/Assessment.md) form, survey or [assessment](../course_elements/Course_Element_Assessment.md), depending on your scenario.

3. Go to the respective tab Form or Survey of the course element and add a suitable form here → "Select, create or import file".

    In the case of the course element Assessment, activate "Rubric assessment" in the tab "Assessment" > "Select rubric form".

4. A list with your form learning resources will appear. Select the prepared form by clicking on the selection tick.

5. If necessary, you can preview the form in the configuration tab by clicking on the name of the form and also edit it as long as the form has not been edited.

6. If required, the other tabs of the course element can be configured.

7. Finally, the course must be published so that the form is visible to the participants and can be filled out.

    To do this, simply close the course editor by clicking on the name of the course in the crumb bar and allow publishing manually or automatically by selecting "Yes" in the selection that appears. Alternatively, you can also use the "Publish" button in the editor on the right side of the toolbar.

    Es ist auch möglich eine Formular Lernressource direkt im Kurs über den entsprechenden Kursbaustein Formular, Umfrage oder Bewertung zu erstellen. Häufig ist es den Erstellenden dann aber nicht bewusst, dass sie eigentlich eine neue _Lernressource_ Formular anlegen.

!!! tip "Tip"

    If necessary, also make sure that the configuration of previous course elements or the top course node does not undesirably restrict editing, e.g. by sequential learning steps or undesirable completion criteria in the [Learning path tab](../course_create/Learning_path_course_-_Course_editor.md).
