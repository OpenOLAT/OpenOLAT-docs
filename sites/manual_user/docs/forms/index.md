Since OpenOlat version 15.5 the learning resource "Form" is available. It
replaces the previous learning resource "Survey" and can be used in the course
as a basis for the course elements "Survey" and "Form". Furthermore, this
learning resource is the basis for the rubric form of the course element
"[Assessment](../course_elements/Course_Element_Assessment.md)" and the basis for the
form of the portfolio task of the type form.

This chapter explains how OpenOlat authors can create forms, which
possibilities the form editor provides, how to use forms and questionnaires
created with them in courses and which options are available for assessment
and result provision.
