# The Idea of Open-Source Software

OpenOlat is an open-source software, which means that its code is at your disposal for free. You can download it, use it, adapt it, and develop it further without having to pay license fees. Further information on this open source project can be found on our community website [www.openolat.com](https://www.openolat.com/). There you can get in contact with the open source community, add your name to the mailing list, and exchange experiences.

Why open source? There are two reasons: Firstly, through the worldwide use of the learning platform in educational institutions and companies, many important inputs for the further development of the software are returned to the OpenOlat team. And secondly, thanks to translators from the open source community, the learning platform is now available in numerous languages and should remain so.
