![](assets/home.png)

After your login you will navigate either to your personal homepage in
OpenOlat, an info page, a page which usually contains general information on
various topics, to the portal or a landing page defined by you. This chapter
will inform you on how to change the settings in your personal menu, on how to
use further features like the full text search and the chat and on how to
adapt the portal to your personal needs. If you cannot see the portal it was
most probably disabled by the system administrator.

### Navigation

In the navigation the [chat](Chat.de.md) is shown first. It is followed by the
number of active users and the full text search. In the navigation your
personal menu can be opened as well. It is divided into [personal
tools](Personal+Menu.html), [configuration](Configuration.html) and system.
Further information about the single elements can be found under the
corresponding link.

In general the chat (instant messenger) is shown in the navigation. Depending
on the settings in the personal menu, more elements can be shown in the
navigation.

In the personal menu the areas personal tools, configuration and system can be
found. Depending on the tools selected in "System settings" certain personal
