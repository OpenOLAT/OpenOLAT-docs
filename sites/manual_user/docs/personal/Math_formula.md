# Math formula

With the help of the html-editor mainly text ist added and formatted in
OpenOlat. For example in the description of the course elements, when creating
a forum entry or in a portfolio entry. But the html-editor cannot only insert
text, but also math formulas. This short overview shows how such a formula can
be inserted and what is to be imagined behind a
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)-Editor.
