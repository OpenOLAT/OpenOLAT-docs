OpenOlat has an internal e-mail module that enables you to send mails from
various points. If the OpenOlat inbox system is disabled, all OLAT e-mails
will be sent exclusively to the respective personal e-mail address.

You can send e-mails with open body from various instances

  * in the course (course elements Mail, Participant list)
  * in the course toolbar
  * via [course reminders](../course_operation/Course_Reminders.md)
  * invitations for courses or groups
  * via visiting card
  * using the group tool Mail
