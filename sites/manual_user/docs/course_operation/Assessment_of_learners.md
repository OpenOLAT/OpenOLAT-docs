The course elements "[Task](Assessing+tasks+and+group+tasks.html)" and
"[Assessment](Assessment+of+course+modules.html)" also offer the possibility
of bulk assessment.

If you want to assess all or many users at once, you can start a "New bulk
assessment". To do this, create an assessment in a spreadsheet program and
paste the data into the mass assessment field using copy+paste. You can find
more information about bulk assessment
[here](+create+a+bulk+assessment+for+submission+tasks.html).

To rate all members of a group you can use the filter function in the tab
"Users" to display only the respective group members and then rate them
according to the course elements or per person as described before.
