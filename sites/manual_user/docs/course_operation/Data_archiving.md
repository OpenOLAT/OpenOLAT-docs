# Data archiving

The archive tool can be found in the administration of courses. Through data
archiving, course owners can save the results of various course elements of a
course. In particular, saving results of the conducted surveys, tests, self-
tests, assignments, group assignments and the course results are important
elements that you should save at the end of the course.

The archiving is usually done in zip format and contains Excel files or for
text formats rtf files. If the archiving includes additional files, these are
provided in subfolders within the zip file.

To save the results, first click on a menu item, e.g. a specific course
element type, then select a concrete element you want to archive and click on
"Archive". The user will be informed by mail in case of longer saving times,
e.g. for log files.
