# Course Operation

  

You have granted access to your course; course participants are already
working on your learning content. This chapter explains which tools can be
used by course authors during course operation, which additional features are
at their disposal and how they can archive course activities. You make most of
the central settings via the tools that you find in the administration of the
course or the respective learning resource. For more information, please refer
to the chapter "[Using the course tools](Using+Course+Tools.html)".

 **Role change:**

If you as a course owner or coach have more than one role in a course (see
[Members management](Members+management.html)), the option to switch user
roles when the editor is closed will appear in the course toolbar, allowing
you to view the course from the perspective of the different roles. Depending
on which roles you have in the course, you will see the respective basic roles
displayed. There is no further distinction between coaches and group coaches
or participants and group participants, but the options within the role coach
or participant are summarized.

The role change is useful if you want to look at the course from the
respective perspective, e.g. as the course owner you want to take on the role
of the participant. It is also possible to view the flow of the course
elements task, group task, checklist or the participant folder from the
participant's point of view.
