# Course planner {: #course_planner}


!!! info "Note"

    As of release 20, OpenOlat has the independent additional module "Course Planner". It is a further development of the curriculum in earlier versions. However, OpenOlat can still be used as a classic LMS without this module.


## What's the purpose of the Course Planner? {: #purpose}

The Course Planner is a module for **course management**. The aim is to create and run courses automatically and efficiently from the quotation.

With the Course Planner, the **planning work** can be separated from the **content creation** (in the author area).

Of course, you can also create OpenOlat courses without Course Planner. However, the Course Planner provides you with a tool that consolidates the organizational tasks.

## Planning tasks {: #planning}

The planning tasks include:

- Create different offer types (e.g. chargeable / not chargeable)

## Planning single courses {: #planning_single_courses}

The Course Planner can be used to create several courses for a course and offer them in the catalog.

This administrative planning work can be done by a course planner even if the course has not yet been created or is not yet available in its final version.

![course_planner_planning_single_course1_v2_de.png](assets/course_planner_planning_single_course1_v2_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" } 

Independently of these administrative tasks (carried out by a course planner), a course can be created by authors as a template and then integrated into all courses.

The courses can also be instantiated automatically on a definable date.

![course_planner_planning_single_course2_v2_de.png](assets/course_planner_planning_single_course2_v2_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" } 

For example, members can be added directly to the individual tours by booking an offer themselves in the catalog.

!!! info "Please note:"

    Course members in the template course are then only the course owners with the author role.

## Planning for structured educational programs {: #planning_structured_product}

Even if participants are to complete an educational product consisting of several courses, they are made members of a specific implementation. (Not members of individual courses or members of the educational product template).

![course_planner_planning_structured_product1_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_planning_structured_product1_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" } 

In addition, a billing system can also be set up for the implementation.

## Who can use the Course Planner? {: #users}

After activation of the Course Planner by a system administrator, it is available to all users with the **role "Course Planner"**. (When using organisational units, the role course planner may also be restricted to certain organisational units.) 

**Administrators** and **principals** also have access. (These roles may also be restricted to organisational units.)

Limited to a specific product, **product owners** and **element owners** can access it within their area of responsibility.

### Products {: #products}

An educational product is an inwardly or outwardly directed learning offer with implementations. In most cases, these are multiple courses, i.e. learning opportunities of the same "type" (-> product). The Course Planner simplifies the work considerably through the shared central administration.

Curricula/products often consist of several courses and have a certain structure/sequence in which the included courses are combined.
