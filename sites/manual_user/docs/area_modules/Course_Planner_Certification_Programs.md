## What is a Certification Program? {: #description}

A certificate may be issued as confirmation of attendance at a course or completion of certain course-related activities. It is also possible to issue a certificate without using a transcript of records.

Certificates for a **single course** are activated and configured in **Course administration > Settings > Tab Assessment**.

![course_planner_certification_programs_process1_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_process1_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

A certificate for **attending one session** or **attending several courses**, on the other hand, can be issued using the **certificate program**. Such certificates are awarded within the **Course Planner** (session). Individuals can be enrolled in a certificate program, and any required recertifications can be managed there (Course Planner > Certificate Program).

![course_planner_certification_programs_process2_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_process2_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

If a member does not meet the required recertification criteria, their membership will be terminated (automatically).

![course_planner_certification_programs_process3_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_process3_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

On the other hand, membership in a certificate program is also possible for candidates, meaning it can begin even before the first certification.

### Tab Members {: #config_tab_members}

To add more people to the certification program and give them the opportunity to earn a certificate, use the **"Add member" button**.

If a training course/measure required for recertification is not completed, a certificate expires and the person concerned is automatically removed from the certification program. This is often a necessary automatic process, for example in the case of safety-related certifications.

Individuals who have left the certification program can be viewed under a separate button. This allows certification program owners to quickly identify and contact them.

The three dots at the end of a list item allow certification program owners to contact the person in question.<br>
The option to revoke certificates can also be found here. This allows, for example, certificates that have been issued automatically in error to be withdrawn manually.

### Tab Messages {: #config_tab_messages}

Notifications and reminders always refer to the current configuration. You can check this again in the upper section.

![course_planner_certification_programs_config_messages_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_config_messages_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

**Notifications**<br>
In the Notifications section, you will find **pre-prepared notifications** for the certificate program according to the current configuration. You can enable/disable these notifications as needed and customize the default templates for the messages. (You can find the button for customizing a template under the three dots or when you have opened the detailed view.)

**Reminders for recertification**<br>
In addition, you can create your own reminders in another section, which will then be sent automatically according to your configuration.

### Tab Implementations {: #config_tab_implementations}

The condition for obtaining a certificate is the successful completion of one of the implementations listed here (OR link, one of the implementations listed here is sufficient). It does not matter whether the implementations are of exactly the same product or course. Therefore, the selection must be made carefully to ensure equivalence.

![course_planner_certification_programs_config_implementations_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_config_implementations_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

If you have created multiple certificate programs, you can display filtered lists:<br>
All - Relevant - Cancelled - Finished

By **clicking on the plus sign** in front of a list entry, you can display the details of this implementation. (You can close the details by clicking on the minus sign.) You can view a lot of information here. To do so, scroll horizontally through the list. 

![course_planner_certification_programs_config_implementations_details1_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_config_implementations_details1_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

Clicking on the trophy icon takes you directly to the rating tool. (You must be a coach or owner to do this.)

Clicking on the light bulb icon will take you to the information page. (You must be a member of the organization to do this.)

!!! tip "Recommendation"

    You can also open the process in a separate browser tab by clicking on the icon with the three dots at the end of a line. This is often helpful for editing.

## Certification program and Credit points {: #credit_points}

**Credit points as requirement**<br>
As explained above, you can make recertification conditional on the prior acquisition of a certain number of credit points. The number of credit points required to obtain the certificate is set under<br>
**Course Planner > Certification program > Tab Settings > Button "Configuration"**. 

**Credit points as a means of payment**<br>
If the certification program issues a certificate, a determinable number of credit points may also be deducted from the credit balance.

## Overview of issued certificates {: #issued_certificates}

Who received which certificate and when? This question is asked by owners of certification programs, administrators, and participants themselves. Depending on your role, there are different ways to get an overview. 

### Overview for certificate program coaches 
In **Course Planner > Certification Programs > "Members" tab**, you will find a list of all participants in the certification program. **Click on the plus sign** in front of a list entry to open the detailed view.
There you will see all certificates for the selected person, including expired and archived certificates.
The buttons above the list help you with presorted lists.

![course_planner_certification_programs_issued_certificates_cp_owner_v1_de.png](assets/course_planner_certification_programs_issued_certificates_cp_owner_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }


### Overview for coaches
As a coach, the easiest way to keep track of your participants' certificates is to continue doing so.

* for single courses in the **assessment tool**
* for multiple courses in the **coaching tool**


### Overview for education managers

Education administrators can view all certificates from different certification programs and courses taken by individual participants at<br>
**Coaching > Education Manager > Select person > Tab Certificate**

### Overview for participants
Participants can find their certificates listed in their **personal menu**. It does not matter whether a certificate comes from a certification program or an individual course.

## Recertification with the certification program {: #recertification}

**Requirements**<br>
The first requirement for recertification with a certification program is that participants must be members of the certification program.<br>
(Course Planner > Certification program > Tab Members)

The second requirement is an existing certificate with an expiration date.<br>
(Course Planner > Certification Program > Settings tab > Configuration button)

Thirdly, it may be that a certain number of credit points must be available before recertification is possible.

**Renewal by owners of the certification program**
Holders of the certificate program can renew a certificate that is still valid at any time and thus extend it at<br>
Course Planner > Certification program > Tab Members > Select member > 3 Points

**Recertification period**
It makes sense for the owners of the certificate program to give participants the opportunity to recertify before the certificate expires. In this context, relevant information and reminders can also be sent out automatically.<br>
(Course Planner > Certification progr<m> > Tab Settings > Button Configuration > Section Receertification)

## Manually issue or revoke certificates {: #manual_certification}

The right to manually issue or revoke certificates lies primarily with the owners of the respective certificate program.<br>
In addition, users with the roles "Administrator" and "Course Planner" also have administrative access.

!!! info "Note"

    If credit points must be paid to obtain a certificate, credit points are also deducted when certificates are issued manually.
