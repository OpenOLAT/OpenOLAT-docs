# Library {: #library}


## Concept {: #concept}

* The library can be activated/deactivated separately as required for the entire instance. 
* There is only one library per OpenOlat instance.
* It usually appears as a menu item in the top navigation bar.
* Technically speaking, the library is a linked resource folder that can be edited in the authoring area.
* Documents in the library can be commented on by users, downloaded or sent directly by e-mail.

## Upload check {: #upload_check}

After uploading a document, it is first checked by default before it is displayed in the library.

Owners of the resource folder linked to the library are informed of a new upload and must approve the document.

Alternatively, another person can be designated for the check and an email address can be entered by the administrator in (Administration > Modules > Library). If no address is entered there, the owner of the learning resource will receive the check request.

As of release 19.1, administrators can also deactivate this check process (Administration > Modules > Library). However, if you deactivate the check, you should be aware that anyone who has access to the library can upload documents there without checking them.
