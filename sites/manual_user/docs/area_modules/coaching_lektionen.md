# Coaching - Lectures

!!! info "Note"

    This tool is only displayed in the Coaching Tool if the Lessons module has been activated by the administrator.

    In addition, there must be at least 1 lesson block. (In at least one course, lesson management must be activated under Settings > Tab "Execution" > Section "Configuration of Lesson and Absence Management in the Course.)

    If these requirements are met, the additional menu item "Lectures" is displayed in the coaching tool.

    See also [Absence management](../learningresources/Lectures_and_absences.md)
