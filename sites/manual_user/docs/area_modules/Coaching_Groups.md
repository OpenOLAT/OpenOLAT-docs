### 1. WHOM does the list show?  {: #groups_who}

The menu item "Groups" shows the list of all groups you are coaching, which are located in the Coaching tool.

Unlike the person and course overview, the group overview only shows OpenOlat users who are registered in one of the course-related groups.

### 2. WHAT does the list show?  {: #groups_what}

You will see at once,

* how many courses the respective group is involved in.
* whether all group members have already logged into the group at least once.
* how many participants the group has in total.
* and how many group members have already passed the associated course. (If a pass has been configured in the course.)

Clicking on a group name opens the list of group members with further information on the score, certificate, etc.

When you click on a user name, the rating tool for that person opens again and you can rate the group member or contact them by e-mail.
