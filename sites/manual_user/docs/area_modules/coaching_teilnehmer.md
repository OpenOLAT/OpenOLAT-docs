### 1. WHOM does the list show?

The menu item "Participants" shows the list of **all the participants you are responsible for**.

  * Each coach only sees the participants they are coaching.
  * The participants from **all** supervised courses are displayed (in contrast to the course assessment tool. There, only participants from the current course are displayed).


### 2. WHAT does the list show?  

You can define the displayed columns yourself by clicking on the cogwheel icon at the top right. Typically you will see:

* Surname, First Name <br>Clicking on the name of a person leads to an overview of all courses of this participant. This gives the teacher access to the assessment areas of a person's course including access to the relevant transcript, the course's assessment tool and the respective lessons.
* Logged in<br>
In the column "Logged in", colour coding and a number provide a quick overview of whether participants have already logged in to all their courses (= green) or whether they have so far only logged in to some of the courses (= orange) or none at all (= red).
* In how many of the courses you supervise is a user a member?
* How many of these have already been attended or passed?
* etc.
