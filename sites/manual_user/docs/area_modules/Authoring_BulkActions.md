#  Authoring - Bulk Actions

As soon as a learning resource has been selected in the first column of the table, additional buttons (1-6) appear above the table. They can be used to carry out actions for the selected resources, i.e. for several learning resources together (Bulk Actions).<br>
For these buttons to be visible, at least one learning resource must be selected.

Clicking on the 3 dots at the end of a table row (10) displays options, which are only for this specific learning resource of this row.

Select the desired learning resources and click on "Send e-mail". A dialog opens. You can now define to whom the e-mail should be sen. Possible recipients are **all course owners, all course coaches and all participants**.

Add a subject and the desired message. If necessary, an attachment and a copy for the sender can be added. 

!!! info "Note"

    You can send the e-mail to all courses that are displayed to you. This also includes courses, which are visible to **all authors**. You do not have to be a member of the course to use this function. 

### 2. Change status

Select the publication status that should apply to all selected learning resources and click on "Change".     

### 3. Modify owners

All **owners of the selected learning resources** are displayed here. You can remove them from several courses at the same time or add new owners to the selected learning resources. An e-mail notification option completes the editing.

### 4. Metadata and settings

Through bulk actions, various **metadata** can be **standardized** here for the selected learning resources, e.g. if several courses belong to a continuing education series. By clicking, a wizard opens.

For all marked learning resources

* the displayed name can be entered under "Taught by"
* the implementation format, e.g. "Exam course", can be selected
* language and time requirements must be defined
* and a suitable licence for the learning resources must be selected
* a suitable subject area and the desired organization for the learning resources must be selected.
* additional rights must be granted for all other authors.
* as well as a consistent execution period and location must be specified.

Courses also have the option of making a consistent selection for the tools in the toolbar.

### 5. Copy

With the **"Copy" button above the table** you can copy **several learning resources**..<br>
By clicking on "Copy" in the **menu that appears under the 3 dots at the end of a row**, you copy a **single learning resource**. (The learning resource of this table row.)

Select one or more learning resources to copy them. For example, to reuse for a new semester or to create a backup copy.

Copied learning resources can then be found in the tab "My entries". The addition ("copy") is added to the title. However, the title can subsequently be changed as desired.

### 6. Delete

A learning resource can only be deleted by the owners of the learning resource.

With the **button above the table** you can quickly delete **several learning resources at once**.<br>
If you only want to delete a **single learning resource**, you can also click on the **3 dots at the end of the respective table row** and then on the option "Delete".

You must confirm this action again in the menu for the sake of safety. The owners of the learning resource will immediately be notified by e-mail. After being deleted, the learning resources no longer appear under "My entries" but are moved to the tab "Deleted" (trash function). There they are only visible to the respective owners. Deleted learning resources can also be restored by the owners.

OpenOlat administrators can also restore deleted learning resources as well as delete them permanently.
