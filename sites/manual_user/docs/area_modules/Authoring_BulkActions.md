#  Authoring - Bulk Actions {: #authoring_bulk_actions}

As soon as a learning resource has been selected in the first column of the table, additional buttons (1-6) appear above the table. They can be used to carry out actions for the selected resources, i.e. for several learning resources together (Bulk Actions).<br>
For these buttons to be visible, at least one learning resource must be selected.

Clicking on the 3 dots at the end of a table row (10) displays options, which are only for this specific learning resource of this row.

Through bulk actions, various **metadata** can be **standardized** here for the selected learning resources, e.g. if several courses belong to a continuing education series. By clicking, a wizard opens.

For all marked learning resources

* language and time requirements must be defined
* and a suitable licence for the learning resources must be selected

By clicking on "Copy" in the **menu that appears under the 3 dots at the end of a row**, you copy a **single learning resource**. (The learning resource of this table row.)

Select one or more learning resources to copy them. For example, to reuse for a new semester or to create a backup copy.

Copied learning resources can then be found in the tab "My entries". The addition ("copy") is added to the title. However, the title can subsequently be changed as desired.

### 6. Delete

A learning resource can only be deleted by the owner of the learning resource, learning resource managers, and administrators.

With the **button above the table** you can quickly delete **several learning resources at once**.<br>
If you only want to delete a **single learning resource**, you can also click on the **3 dots at the end of the respective table row** and then on the option "Delete".

You must confirm this action again in the menu for the sake of safety. The owners of the learning resource will be notified by e-mail, if configured.

After deletion, the learning resources will only appear in the ["**Deleted**" tab](../area_modules/Authoring.md#authoring-deleted) (trash function) for the respective owners, learning resource managers, and administrators.

As the owner, you can restore deleted learning resources. Only administrators or learning resource managers can permanently delete learning resources.
