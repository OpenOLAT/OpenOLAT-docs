# Question Pool Sharing Options

There are different ways to give other users access to personal question items in the question pool. You can also decide whether the users are only allowed to view the questions or whether they are also allowed to change them.

## a) Make single users the co-owner of a question

Here the selected user becomes the (co-)owner of the question and the question also appears under "My questions" for this person. Similar to OpenOlat learning resources, the co-owner has all permissions for this question.

Go to the "My Question Pool" → "My Questions" section, select the desired question(s), and use the "Author Rights" link to select the user you want to make the co-owner of the question.

## b) Sharing in the pool

Questions can be shared with additional users by adding them to one or more existing question pools. Which question pools are available and can be selected depends on the pool administrator. Usually at least one public pool exists.

Go to the "My Question Pool" → "My Questions" section, select the question(s) you want to share and select "Share" → "Share in Pool" via the link and select the desired pool. You will then have the option to decide whether or not the question may also be edited in the shared pool.

## c) Release in a group

You can also make questions accessible to an [OpenOlat group](../groups/index.md) created in advance. For example, create a group if you want to work with several users on a collection of questions for an online test or develop a common question base. The advantage with this way is that you can compose the users individually and add more users to the group relatively easily later.

Go to the "My Question Pool" → "My Questions" section, select the question(s) you want to share, and select "Share" → "Share in Group" via the link and select the group you want. You then have the option to decide whether the question in the shared pool may also be edited or not.

Attention the shared questions are only referenced and not copied. Subsequent changes are made to the same question by all authorized persons. If you want to keep the original question, you should copy it first.

The use of the [review process](Question_Bank_Review_Process.md) as well as the use of the status also lends itself to the joint work on questions.
