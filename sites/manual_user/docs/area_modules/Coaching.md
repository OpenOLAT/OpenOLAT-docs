# Coaching - Overview

## What is the Coaching Tool for? {: #purpose}

The Coaching Tool is used for the **cross-course** organization and administration of courses, participants and groups, as well as the **cross-course** correction of assessment modules, the **cross-course** absence management and the external corrector flow of OpenOlat tests.

With the coaching tool, course owners, course coaches and group coaches have the possibility to see and manage all course or group participants assigned to them at a glance. They can then quickly go from these overviews to the assessment tool for individual participants in different ways.

## When is the Coaching tool available? {: #availability}

The "Coaching" menu option is only displayed if coaching has been activated in the OpenOlat administration.

Whether the coaching tool is displayed in the main menu depends on other factors:

* **System roles**: Guests and external parties are not permitted to provide coaching.
* The **course role** must be a coach or owner. Participants cannot provide coaching. 
* The **course status** must be "Published", "Approved for instructors", or "Completed".
* Whether there are **participants** (at least 1 person) in a course or group.

## The focus elements {: #focus_elements}

The coaching tool often displays a list of the people you are coaching.
If, for example, you are only a direct coach in one course but also an education manager, you can access all other participants based on this role.

You can select one of your roles using the focus elements above the list. This will give you a preselection. The list will then only contain people you are responsible for in this role.
