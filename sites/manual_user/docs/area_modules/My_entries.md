# My entries

In the "Show my entries" section of Portfolio 2.0, all personal entries are listed, usually in chronological order. This gives you an overview of all your entries and you can see how far an entry has progressed based on its status (e.g. draft or published).

In the "My entries" area, it does not matter in which folder an entry is located or whether an entry is assigned to a folder at all. All entries are listed. 


!!! info "Hint"

    "My entries" can be displayed in two different ways. The table view offers the possibility to display further details of the entries, e.g. whether an entry was referenced or whether comments are available.


## Create new entries

New entries can be created via the link at the top right. Optionally, it is possible to upload a cover image for the new entry, add a keyword under Category and - if the taxonomy is activated - assign the entry to a competence area. The new entry can either be assigned to an existing folder and an existing area there or initially created independently of folders (so-called floating entry). You then access the [Portfolio Editor](../area_modules/The_portfolio_editor_17_1.md) and can add content to the entry and also create a link to elements of the [Media Center](../personal_menu/Media_Center.md). However, no complete portfolio entries are stored in the Media Center. 

You can also access the Portfolio Editor by clicking on an existing entry. 

!!! info "Info"

    Entries can also refer to forms and originate from a collected portfolio. In this case, the Portfolio Editor is not available. 


## Timeline

The timeline provides the user with a graphical overview of the activities in the portfolio. The colored dots indicate when something was changed. By left-clicking on a point, details of the corresponding entries appear. The different colors stand for the respective status of the entry. The timeline is helpful if an e-portfolio is used over a certain period of time, e.g. over a semester or a year.
