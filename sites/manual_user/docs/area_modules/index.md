# Area and modules {: #sites}

OpenOlat has a modular structure. The most important areas and modules are generally available, some can be additionally activated as needed. The central elements usually appear as a menu item in the top navigation bar. [Personal areas](../personal_menu/index.md) can be accessed via the "Personal tools". 

If the module is activated, availability in the main menu is also role-dependent. <br>
The order/arrangement in the header can be determined by the administrator.


## Courses
Courses are the most important basic element in OpenOlat. Basically, all learning content is offered within courses.

## Catalog
If a catalog for offering the courses and learning resources is desired, this optional module can be activated by the [OpenOlat administrator](../../manual_admin/administration/Modules_Catalog_2.0.md). Depending on the version of the catalog, it appears as a separate menu item [(Catalog V2)](../area_modules/catalog2.0.md) or as a tab in the Courses area [(Catalog V1)](../area_modules/catalog1.0.md).
