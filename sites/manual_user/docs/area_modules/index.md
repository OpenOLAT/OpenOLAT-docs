# Area and modules
OpenOlat has a modular structure. The most important areas and modules are generally available, some can be additionally activated as needed. The central elements usually appear as a menu item in the top navigation bar. [Personal areas](../personal_menu/index.md) can be accessed via the "Personal tools". 

## Courses
Courses are the most important basic element in OpenOlat. Basically, all learning content is offered within courses.

## Catalog
If a catalog for offering the courses and learning resources is desired, this optional module can be activated by the [OpenOlat administrator](../../manual_admin/administration/Modules_Catalog_2.0.md). Depending on the version of the catalog, it appears as a separate menu item [(Catalog V2)](../area_modules/catalog2.0.md) or as a tab in the Courses area [(Catalog V1)](../area_modules/catalog1.0.md). 

## Groups
Groups can be used for different purposes e.g. they simplify participant administration or facilitate cooperative, independent online learning.

## Coaching
Tool for coaches to easily carry out cross-course assessments and actions.

## Authoring area
Central area for OpenOlat authors. Here you can find everything needed to create new courses.

## Question pool
The question pool is an area where questions are collected for reuse. OpenOlat offers a management of access permissions etc. for this purpose.

## Projects
Tool for collaborative project work with deadlines, to-dos, decision documentation, shared documents and more.

## Curriculum management
If approved by the administrator, OpenOlat can also optionally manage curricula in a separate module.
