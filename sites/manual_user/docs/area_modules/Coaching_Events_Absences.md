![coaching_events_absences_events_coach-master_v1_de.png](assets/coaching_events_absences_events_coach-master_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

At the top level, you can focus the view of your appointments and absences on your role as a coach or, if applicable, as a class teacher.

In the [Course Planner](../../manual_user/area_modules/Course_Planner.md), it is possible to assign the role of homeroom teacher to a person. 
(Prerequisite: The Course Planner module has been activated by an administrator.)
This may be a different person for each session. In this case, the dates and absences of your classes will be displayed in the coaching tool.
