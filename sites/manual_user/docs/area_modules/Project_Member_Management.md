# Projects - Member Management

The project members are usually made project members by the project owner(s). (As a rule, project management lies with the person who creates the new project).

## External members

If people who are not registered as users in OpenOlat are also to work on the project, they can be invited as external members.

As soon as a project member is registered, he or she receives a link. After calling up the link, a wizard guides the new project member through login and registration.

!!! info "Note"

    "External member" is not a role. An external member can have all roles except owner (role that can be used to delete the whole project).
