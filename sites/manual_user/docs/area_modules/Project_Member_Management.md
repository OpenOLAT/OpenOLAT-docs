# Projects - Member Management

The project members are usually made project members by the project owner(s). (As a rule, project management lies with the person who creates the new project.)

## External members

If people who are not registered as users in OpenOlat are also to work on the project, they can be invited as external members. They can then use OpenOlat for a maximum of 180 days.

As soon as a project member is registered, he or she receives a link. After calling up the link, a wizard guides the new project member through login and registration.

!!! info "Note"

    "External member" is not a role. An external member can have all roles except owner (role that can be used to delete the whole project).
