# Question pool: Create Questions {: #question_pool_create_questions}

![Fragenpool](assets/Fragenpool_favoriten.png)

The table view of the questions stored in the question pool offers a wide range of options. Make sure that all the columns relevant to you are selected using the cogwheel symbol.

You can mark particularly relevant questions as **favorites** and find them again quickly. Another option is to organize several questions in **lists** and thus create an individual system for your questions.

You can create or import questions in the "My questions" area, in a list or in a group share. However, the question items are always stored under "My questions" and then referenced. 

An overview of the **question types** that can be created and imported can be found in the chapter ["Test Question types"](../learningresources/Test_question_types.md) 

## Create questions in the question pool

Question items can be created in the question pool using the "Create question" button in QTI 2.1 format and saved directly for further use.

During creation, a title is specified, followed by the question type and finally, if available, the subject area is selected. The questions created in this way can then be imported and used in the OpenOlat learning resource Test.

Information on _test creation_ can be found [here](https://docs.openolat.org/manual_how-to/test_creation_procedure/test_creation_procedure/). Information on the further structure of a question in the chapter ["Detailed view of a question"](Item_Detailed_View.md).
