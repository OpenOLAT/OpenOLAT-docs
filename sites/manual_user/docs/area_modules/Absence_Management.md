# Absence management {: #absence_management}

## What does absence management enable?  {: #purpose}

The absence management displayed in the main menu refers to **cross-course absence management** by authorized persons with the **role of absence manager**.

Users with this role process exemptions and appeals, for example. This administrative task goes beyond simple data entry, which takes place in a specific course, and is therefore assigned to a separate role.

Absences can also be queried or recorded in other places.<br>
Links to explanations of the remaining points can be found under [further information](#further_information) or explained in the [basic concepts]((../basic_concepts/Events_and_Absences.md)).

## Who can use the absence management? {: #users}

Course owners decide whether absence management is used in a particular course.

The **recording** of individual absences is then usually the responsibility of the coaches. That is why they will find the tools for recording absences in the courses or in the coaching tool.
Participants record their own absences/cancellations/appeals in the [personal menu >](../personal_menu/Absences.md).

The absence management function displayed in the main menu and described below can be made available to **absence administrators** and administrative roles. In cross-course absence management, all absences can be accessed in the overview, and authorized persons can **manage** all absences comprehensively.

## Activation of the "Absence Management" module {: #activation}

As with all modules, [general activation](../../manual_admin/administration/Modules_Events_and_Absences.md) is carried out by administrators.

In order for absence management to be available in the main menu, the "Appointments and Absences" module must have been activated by an administrator. Further information can be found [here](../../manual_admin/administration/Modules_Events_and_Absences.md).

The activation and configuration of the appointment and absence management for a specific course is then carried out in the course administration:<br>
**Administration > Settings > Tab "Implementations" > Section "Configuration Event & Absence Management in course"**<br>
Find out more about this [here](../learningresources/Events_and_absences.md).
