# Finding courses

The "Courses" menu item gives you access to the courses and possibly other
learning resources available to you. Click on the "Courses" menu item in the
main navigation at the top.

## My courses

Under "My Courses", you can view all courses and learning resources that are active, in preparaion or finished. Or use the search to find a
course or learning resource based on a keyword.

You can also filter your courses based on various criteria, including the
timeline, membership status, and results. To do so, click the small arrow and
more filter options will appear. Learn more about how to best filter your
tables [here](../basic_concepts/Table_Concept.md).

## Search

Use the search function to find all the learning resources you have access to.
Enter a keyword or the course title and have the matching courses or learning
resources displayed. Unfold the filter option to further narrow the search
based on the filters. You can also save the filter setting.

If you do not find a course, make sure that you have not activated a filter
that you do not want, e.g. only courses that you have not yet passed are
found. In this case, remove the corresponding filter.

Mark the course as a favorite when you have found it. To do this, click on the
white flag, which will then turn red. The next time you log in, you will find
the course directly in your favorites.

## Catalog

Wird der OpenOlat Katalog 1.0 in Ihrer Instanz verwendet sehen Sie den Tab "Katalog" im Bereich der Kurse. 

The OpenOlat catalog is similar to a paper version of the course catalog. The
structure of the catalog can be set up by the OpenOlat administrator.
Für OpenOlat Benutzer bietet sich der Katalog für die Suche nach bestimmten Kursen und Lernressourcen an. Weitere Informationen zum Katalog 1.0  finden Sie [hier](../area_modules/catalog1.0.md).

!!! Info 

    Ist der Katalog generell deaktiviert erscheint der Menüpunkt _nicht_. 
    Wird der [Katalog 2.0](../area_modules/catalog2.0.md) :octicons-tag-24: Release 17.0 verwendet dann erscheint der Katalog als eigener Menüpunkt in der obersten Navigation und nicht unter "Kurse". 


## Curriculum

If a user also has courses assigned to a curriculum, the
„[Curricula](Curriculum_Management.md)" section will also appear in the
"Courses" menu.
