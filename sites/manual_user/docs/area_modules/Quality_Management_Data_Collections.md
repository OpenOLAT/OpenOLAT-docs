Create a new data collection there.

![quality_management_data_collection_create_v1_de.png](assets/quality_management_data_collection_create_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

You will first be asked to specify a form learning resource.
Select an existing one or create a new one.

The properties and functionality of data collection are defined in 5 tabs. E-mails with a link to the form will be sent to the participants specified here at the specified time. At the end, a report is generated to which the persons named in the "Report authorizations" tab have access. (As soon as a report is available, another "Report" tab is displayed).

**Tab "Configuration"**<br>
After the start of data collection, all participants can complete and submit the form selected here during the specified period. After this deadline, it is no longer possible to submit the form. 

At the end of the submission period, the report is available to all persons listed in the "Report authorizations" tab.

**Tab "Participants"**
In this tab, the group of respondents is defined, i.e. who receives the invitation to participate with the link to the form by e-mail.

Groups of people can be searched for or added using the "Add participants" button. An invitation via email list is also possible.

A link can be generated by activating the toggle button “Access via public link”. Anyone who uses this link can then participate in the data collection without being registered as an OpenOlat user.

**Tab "Reminders"**
Various reminder e-mails can be prepared which are sent automatically when the selected shipping conditions are met.

The invitation is an e-mail to the participants with a link to the form. If no information is provided, no e-mail will be sent and participants must be informed by other means. (E.g. by lecturers in class.)

**Tab "Action to-dos"**
The results of data surveys or a specific participant survey can be responded to directly with appropriate measures. Necessary to-dos can be created contextually and delegated directly to the relevant persons. You will be informed of a new to-do by e-mail. All to-dos are available in the new section ["Action To-dos"](Quality_Management_To-dos.md).

**Tab "Permission report"**<br>
Once data collection has been completed, the reports can be accessed by the listed persons.
In the "Permissions report" tab, you can determine<br>
a) who is allowed to see which reports<br>
b) and whether/how information is provided.

* **Online access** = The recipients listed in the 1st column can access reports online.
* **E-mail on completion** = The recipients listed in the 1st column receive an e-mail as soon as a report has been generated.
* **E-mail for qualitative feedback** = The recipients listed in the 1st column will receive an e-mail as soon as a report has been generated and the **text fields** in the form have been filled in or a file has been uploaded by the respondents.

Quality managers have access to the current status of data collection even before completion.

**Tab "Report"**<br>
This tab is only visible if a report is available.
