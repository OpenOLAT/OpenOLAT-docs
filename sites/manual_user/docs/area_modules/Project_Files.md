# Projects:  Files {: #files}

Under "Files" in the "Quick Access" section, files can be **uploaded** and new files **created** in a project. This way, all files can be saved together with the project. All media are then in the same place.  They are only available within the project.

In general, files for a project can be uploaded, created or added from other OpenOlat areas. This is done either via ‘Quick access’ or in the ‘Files’ area. The options in the ‘Files’ area are more extensive. 

The ‘Quick access’ section generally displays the six most recently used files *and* notes. These can simply be opened or downloaded by clicking on the document and edited further if necessary.

The six most recently added files are displayed in the ‘Files’ section and can also be opened or downloaded directly and edited further if necessary. 



## Upload files {: #upload}

The quickest way to upload files is in the ‘Quick access’ area. 

![Dateien hochladen im Schnellzugriff](assets/Projekte_a.jpg){ class="shadow lightbox" } 

The uploaded files can be opened directly depending on the format. 
The following principles apply:

- If no Microsoft licence is available, docx, pptx and xlsx are for example opened with OnlyOffice, if a licence is available for it.
- Pdf files are usually opened with OnlyOffice
- Images are opened in the browser.
- File formats that require special software are not opened. OpenOlat offers a download instead. The file can thus still be saved together with the other data in the project.<br>Example: Mac file formats, such as Pages or Keynote.

![projekte_dateien_dokument_erstellen_v1_de.png](assets/projekte_dateien_dokument_erstellen_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

The following file formats can be created:

* .drawio (Diagram)
* .dwb (Whiteboard)
* .text (Unformatted text)
* .html (HTML-Document)

* .xml (Extensible Markup Language)


!!! info "Create office documents"

    Whether Microsoft file formats can be created depends on whether licences are available. Contact your administrator for this.
    
    Without licences, the options for creating docx, pptx and xlsx formats are not displayed. (However, displaying and editing existing documents with ONLYOFFICE is usually possible.)

## Edit files together {: #edit}

The integration of document editors enables collaborative work.

* The existing files can be edited by all project members.
* Even **simultaneous editing** (e.g. of a Word file during an online meeting) is possible if the corresponding licences for the document editor are available.

If necessary, contact your administrator.
