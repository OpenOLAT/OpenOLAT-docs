### Tab Open Assessments {: #tab_open_assessments}

Here you have access to all course elements that still need to be assessed. These can be sorted according to the columns and then selected and evaluated individually. Clicking on the "Assess" link takes you to the corresponding assessment form.

### Tab Open Classifications/Scores {: #tab_open_classifications_scores}

Here you will find all course elements that have already been assessed but for which the manual assignment to a grading scale or grading system has not yet been completed.

The tab is only relevant if at least one course element has also been assigned a rating scale for manual release.
