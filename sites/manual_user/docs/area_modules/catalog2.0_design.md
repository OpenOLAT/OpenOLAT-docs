# Catalog 2.0 - Design  {: #catalog_design}


Images are used in the catalog for various illustrative purposes. Below you will find information on where and in what size images are best imported.


## Image size  {: #image_size}

If images are already imported into OpenOlat in a suitable size, OpenOlat no longer needs to adjust them to a suitable format or aspect ratio. Certain image sizes are therefore recommended.


!!! tip "Hint"

    The patterns offered below (semi-transparent png) can be placed over the current image in the graphics program to select the appropriate section.<br>

**Recommended image size:** max. 570 x 380 px, 72dpi, file size max. 5.1MB <br>

**Displayable information under the image:** The following information can optionally be displayed on the tile. These texts are not on the image, but are displayed below the image.

- Identification mark
- Teaser
- Departments/Catalog
- Format of execution
- Main language
- Place of execution
- Time of execution
- Author
- Time requirement

For space reasons, it is recommended not to display all information on the tile at the same time. Therefore, a selection should generally be made for all tiles in the catalog under **Administration > Module > Catalog > Tab "Layout"**. The height of the tiles automatically adjusts to the space required.<br>
