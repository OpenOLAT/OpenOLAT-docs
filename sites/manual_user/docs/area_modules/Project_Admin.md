# Projects - Administration

To access the project administration of your project, open the desired project and click on the 3 dots at the top right. Several administrative options appear in the expanded menu. 

The administration of a project includes

* the configuration and display of the start page (edit project) 
* the [member management](../area_modules/Project_Member_Management.md) of the project
* the option to download [Reports](../area_modules/Project_Report.md)
* copying projects
* saving projects as a template
* ending and completing projects
* deleting projects

!!! info "Info"

    Which menu items appear in the area depends on the project role.

## Edit project

"Edit project" does not refer to editing the content (entering appointments, creating to-dos, etc.), but to **editing the start page** of the project.

## Project templates

It simplifies the creation of a new project if a template can be used.

A created project can be saved as a template. To do this, select the “Save as template” option in the 3-dot menu. 

![projekte_admin_als_vorlage_speichern_v2_de.png](../area_modules/assets/projekte_admin_als_vorlage_speichern_v3_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

A menu appears. Here you can specify, among other things, whether the template should only be available for your own use or for all members of the organizational unit.

You can also create a blank template in the Project Templates tab, which is often a more useful option.

The following (filter) functions are available there for your administrative tasks:

* **No activity recently**<br>
This list contains projects in which there has been no activity for more than 28 days. Their status can be "active" or "completed". Projects in this list should be checked to see if they can be closed or deleted. (You can check with the project owner).

If projects have been closed for a long time, project managers can use this list to ask whether projects can be deleted.<br>
Completed projects can still be reactivated.

* **Deleted**<br>
Deleted projects can still be viewed, but no longer edited.
