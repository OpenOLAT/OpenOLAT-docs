### 1. WHICH courses does the list show? {: #courses_which}

The "Courses" menu item in the Coaching Tool shows a list of all **courses** in which you are a **coach** or **owner**.

* Participants from **all** courses you supervise are displayed. (This differs from the course's [assessment tool](../learningresources/Assessment_tool_overview.md), which only displays participants from the current course.)
* Each coach can only see the participants they are supervising.
* The participants you are supervising are **grouped and assigned roles** that you, as their coach, have in relation to them.<br> 
In the example shown above, the caregiver can access pre-sorted lists that correspond to their two roles as caregiver and Kurt owner.
* In the list for instructors, you will only see courses that have been published, completed, or are at least accessible to instructors.

    By clicking on the small buttons at the top right above the list, you can switch between list and tile view at any time.

You will see at a glance:

* Which courses (learning resources) you are a tutor for,
* How many participants are there in these courses?
* and how far the processing of these courses has progressed overall.

From this list, you can switch directly to a course and the assessment tool used there.  
Clicking on a course name takes you directly to the course. There, you can navigate further to individual participants and view performance overviews or absence management.

You can choose which columns are displayed by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner.


* **ID** (unique number)
* **Favorite**
* **Type** (Cube icon for "course"; for stand-alone learning resources, a corresponding different icon)
