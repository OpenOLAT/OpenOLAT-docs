### WHOM does the list show?  {: #people_who}

The menu item "Participants" shows the list of **all the participants you are responsible for**.

  * The participants from **all** coached courses are displayed (in contrast to the course [assessment tool](../learningresources/Assessment_tool_overview.md). There, only participants from the current course are displayed.)
  * Each coach only sees the participants they are coaching.
  * The participants you are supervising are **grouped and assigned roles** that you, as their coach, have in relation to them.<br>
  In the example shown above, the caregiver can access presorted lists that correspond to their roles:
    * As Coach
    * As Course Owner
    * As Line Manager
    * As Education manager


!!! hint "Note on the role line manager"

    ![coaching_people_line_manager_v1_de.png](assets/coaching_people_line_manager_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }
    This role is only displayed in the Coaching Tool if the [Organization module](../../manual_admin/administration/Modules_Organisations.md) has been activated by the administrator. If you are a line manager, you can be informed about the learning progress within your organizational unit. Automatic notification of all certificates received is also possible.


!!! hint "Note on other personal relationships"

    Even if you have defined your [own roles and relationships](../../manual_user/basic_concepts/Assign_Roles.md#role_assignment_relations), these roles will be displayed here so that you can view a pre-grouped list.
