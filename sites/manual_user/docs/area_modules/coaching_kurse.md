* and also meet the other requirements listed in the table above.


### 2. WHAT does the list show?

You will see at a glance:

* the number of participants in each course,
* the progress of the course participants
* as well as the extent of the course participants' login.
  * A green dot symbolises that all course participants have logged in at least once.
  * An orange dot indicates that some of the course participants have already called up the course before.

Another click on a course name leads to an overview of the course participants you supervise for this course and one can quickly see the course progress of the participants. You can then navigate back to the assessment tool of a course participant as well as display the performance overview or the absence management.
