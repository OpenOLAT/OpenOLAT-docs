# Global search

You will find the global search in the top right-hand corner of the header. Click on the magnifying glass symbol.

If you enter a search term here and confirm it by pressing the Enter key or clicking on the magnifying glass next to it, a **search across all** will take place.


This means that the **entire OpenOlat system** is searched and also within the documents. It is a [full text search](Search_General.md#full_text_search).
