# Accessibility: Basic principals {: #principals}


In developing OpenOlat, we are working towards achieving WCAG 2.1 compliance with AA. 

WCAG is an international accessibility standard with the aim of promoting accessible content, see [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). 

The WCAG 2.1 AA standard is also mentioned or required internationally in many legal texts and specifications for public institutions.
