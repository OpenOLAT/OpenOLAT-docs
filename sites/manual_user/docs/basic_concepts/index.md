## [Roles and rights](Roles_Rights.md)

Here you can learn more about login, sessions, timeout, etc.

## [Framework](Navigation.md)

Here you can find information about cross-platform features such as chat, search function, etc.

## [Technology](Technology.md)

Here you can learn more about the tools used to develop OpenOlat. Besides, various supporting technologies are used. (E.g. WebDAV, a special editor for math formulas, etc.)
