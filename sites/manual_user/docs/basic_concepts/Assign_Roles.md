# Roles and Rights: Assign roles {: #role_assignment}


## Role assignment for system roles {: #role_assignment_system}

System-wide roles are assigned in the user management:<br>
**User management > Selecting a user > Tab "Roles"**<br>
Accordingly, the assignment is typically made by user management or administrators.

"User" is entered as the default role. Depending on the area of responsibility, additional roles - and therefore additional rights - must be activated.
