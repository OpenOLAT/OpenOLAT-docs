# Roles and Rights: Assign roles {: #role_assignment}


## Role assignment for organisation roles {: #role_assignment_org}

Organisation-wide or system-wide roles are assigned in the user management:<br>
**User management > Selecting a user > Tab "Roles"**<br>
Accordingly, the assignment is typically made by user management or administrators.

Depending on the area of responsibility, roles - and therefore additional rights - must be added.

**Roles for new course members**<br>

**Change roles of group members**<br>
If there is already a membership in a group and you want to change the role of the person, you can do this (if you have the authorization to edit) in the administration of the group.

**Groups > Administration > Members tab > Icon with 3 dots at the end of the row of the member in question > Option "Edit member"**


![roles_rights_groups_v1_de.png](assets/roles_rights_groups_v1_de.png){ class=" shadow lightbox" }
![roles_rights_group_member_edit_v1_de.png](assets/roles_rights_group_member_edit_v1_de.png){ class=" shadow lightbox" }


**Assignment of the group coach role**<br>
When you create a new group, you are automatically the coach of this group. Coaches of a group also receive the "Administration" link in the menu. If desired, additional people can then be made group coaches.<br>
(Procedure: Groups > Administration > Members tab > Icon with 3 dots at the end of the line of the member in question > Option "Edit member")

**Assignment of the group administrator**<br>
As group administrators perform cross-group tasks, this is a organisation-wide role. Therefore, this role is not assigned within a specific group, but in the user administration (procedure as for organisation-wide roles).
