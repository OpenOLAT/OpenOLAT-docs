# Roles and Rights: User types {: #user_types} 

## Die 3 Benutzertypen

OpenOlat works with role and rights management. At the highest level, a distinction is made between 3 basic user types. These are

### **Registered users** (Standard)<br>
All users have a unique user name that is used for identification after registration. Users can use unlocked learning content and participate in all learning activities. Learning outcomes (e.g. from tests) are assigned to the user name. In addition, all users have an individually configurable start page and [storage space](../personal_menu/Personal_folders.md) at their disposal. All registered users can also create their own [groups](../groups/index.md) and use all the functions and tools contained therein. 

Registered users without further roles and rights are usually learners.

Registered users can also be assigned one or more additional roles. Each of these roles is associated with rights for certain tasks. 

### Further user types

* **External users**<br>
are known in OpenOlat with their e-mail address. However, there is no complete data record with user data, as is the case with registered users. Accordingly, external users cannot take on most roles in OpenOlat as they require full registration.
External users can be converted to full registered users if required.


* **Anonymous guests**<br>
Guests have limited access to OpenOlat without registering. They can view learning content released for guests, but cannot participate in all learning activities. The link to guest access can be found on the login page. You can find further information about guest access [here](guest_access.md).




!!! info "Note"

    It goes without saying that almost all roles can only be assigned to registered users. Anonymous guests and external users (only known by e-mail) cannot take on any tasks (such as coach or administrator) within OpenOlat.
