# Search in the File Hub {: #search_in_file_hub}

The [File Hub](../personal_menu/File_Hub.md), which you can find under [Personal tools](../personal_menu/Personal_Tools.md), is a personal file explorer and shows all available files of the OpenOlat instance. Including integrated external sources such as Sharepoint and OneDrive. In other words, you have access to all files for which you have access authorization.

Accordingly, the search in the File Hub is primarily aimed at **files** that you want to copy or move, for example.

!!! info "Background information"

    **File Hub = File System + Additional info (metadata)**

    OpenOlat's File Hub uses an image of the file system, which is supplemented with metadata. This is used for indexing.

    The image is constantly updated automatically. If necessary, a synchronization can also be triggered manually.
