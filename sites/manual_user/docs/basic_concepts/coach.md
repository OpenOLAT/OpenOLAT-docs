# Roles and Rights: The role of a coach {: #coach}

"Coach" is one of the 3 course roles (next to participant and course owner).

In this role, you do not normally have the right to edit the course. However, you can view the work status and test results of course members with the ‘Participant’ role.
This is typically the role that **teachers** are assigned to accompany course participants.

If the coaching task only relates to some of the course participants, groups can be formed.
The role of **group coach** exists for groups.

## Rights of coaches {: #coach_rights}

Here you will find an overview of the rights of the coach.
