# Working with media files {: #media_files}

Media files used in OpenOlat are usually uploaded and integrated directly at the place of use. You will find the media in 3 different locations. 


## Folder

There are folders in various places in OpenOlat in which media files are also stored. In these folders, the files can be exchanged as a whole. (This is possible because the folders are not provided with additional metadata).

**Examples:**

* [Storage folder of a course >](../basic_concepts/Folder_Concept.md#storage-folder--storage_folder)
* [Group folder >](../basic_concepts/Folder_Concept.md#folder-for-members-of-a-group-group-folder--group_folder)



## Learning content in the Content Editor

Media files that are integrated with the [Content Editor](../basic_concepts/Content_Editor.md) are stored in the [Media Center](../basic_concepts/Media_Center_Concept.md).

**Advantages:**

* The media can be used in other course elements that also obtain their media from the [Media Center](../basic_concepts/Media_Center_Concept.md).
* Rights management is available for sharing media with other authors.
* The media files can be provided with metadata for better management. 


## Fixed assigned media

For learning resources in the author area that contain media files, these media are permanently assigned to the respective learning resource.

**Examples:**

* [Blog >](../learningresources/Blog.md)
* [Wiki >](../learningresources/Wiki.md)
* [Test >](../learningresources/Test.md)
