# Navigation

After your login you will navigate either to

* a defined start page e.g. author area for authors or course area for non-authors
* an info page, a page that usually contains general information on various topics (similar to a course with info),
* the OpenOlat portal or
* a start page defined individually by you. Each OpenOlat page can be marked as an individual start page.

This chapter will inform you on how to change the settings in your [personal menu](../personal_menu/Configuration.md), on how to use further features like the [full text search](Full_Text_Search.md) and the [chat](Chat.md) and on how to adapt the [portal](Portal_configuration.md) to your personal needs.

!!! info

    If you cannot see the portal it was most probably disabled by the system administrator.

## Global navigation

In the navigation the [chat](Chat.md) is shown first. Depending on the settings in the personal menu, more elements can be shown in the navigation.
