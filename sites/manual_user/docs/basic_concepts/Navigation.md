# Navigation

After your login you will navigate either to

* a defined starting page e.g. author area for authors or course area for non-authors
* an info page, a page that usually contains general information on various topics (similar to a course with info),
* the OpenOlat portal or
* a start page defined individually by you. Each OpenOlat page can be marked as an individual starting page.


!!! info

    If you cannot see the portal, it was most probably disabled by the system administrator.

## Global navigation

In the navigation the [chat](Chat.md) is shown first. Depending on the settings in the personal menu, more elements can be shown in the navigation.
