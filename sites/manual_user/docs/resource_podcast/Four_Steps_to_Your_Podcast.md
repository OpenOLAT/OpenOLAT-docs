# Four Steps to Your Podcast

With the aid of this guideline you will be able to add a podcast to your
course in no time and create your first episode.

##  Requirements

Produce an audio or video file for your podcast episode by means of
appropriate recording software (e.g.
[GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ "GarageBand")) before
saving it in MP3, MP4, M4V, M4A or AAC.

In case you have not created a course yet you will get further information in
the chapter ["Creating Courses"](Creating+Courses.html) on how to proceed
before generating a podcast by means of the following instruction.

##  Create Podcast

  

Step 1: Open course editor and insert podcast course element  
---  
1| Search for your course in "Authoring", section "My entries," and open it.|

3| Select position at which your Podcast course element should be inserted by
clicking on it.  
4| Select "Podcast" in the pop-up "Insert course elements" in the toolbar.  
5| Indicate a short title for your course element in the tab "Title and
description" and save your settings.

If you already have an external podcast, you can also include it.

"Publish". Add a description if necessary.|

Additional episodes can be added later on following the same pattern or
directly within the course view.

  

  

Note: Step 3 is also required if learners are to upload podcasts. In any case,
the first episode, i.e. the first video, must be uploaded by the teacher
before the learners can upload videos themselves.

Step 4: Publish and activate course  
---  
1|

The easiest way to publish a course is to close the course editor and switch
directly to the normal course view.

Simply click on the course title in the bread crumb bar and a query will
appear asking you how you want to publish the course.

Select "Yes, automatically" if you want to publish all changes made. Select
"Yes, manually" if you only want to select some changes for publication.

Alternativ kann auch der ausführliche Publizier-Prozess über den Link in der
Toolbar im Kurseditor gewählt werden.

  

Your podcast is now embedded and course participants can download the first
episode.

As with all OpenOlat learning resources, the learning resource (here Podcast)
can be created first and then the created learning resource can be integrated
into the desired course.
