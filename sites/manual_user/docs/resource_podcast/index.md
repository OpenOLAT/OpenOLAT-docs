Podcasts are learning resources in OpenOlat that can be integrated into
OpenOlat courses.

This chapter explains step by step how course authors can create podcasts
before embedding them in their course. Furthermore you will find information
on additional configuration possibilities.

## General information about Podcast

The term "Podcasting" comprises words such as "iPod" and "Broadcasting" and
means producing and providing audio as well as video files. Podcasts can be
subscribed to before uploading episodes either by means of online services
such as iTunes to mobile devices or using them directly within OpenOlat. Such
episodes will be shown sorted by time; the latest news will always appear on
top. Course participants will be able to assess episodes and comment on them.

An advantage of podcasts is that media data can easily be provided and used
regardless of location. Additionally you can produce as well as use episodes
independently of any broadcasting time compared to radio shows.
