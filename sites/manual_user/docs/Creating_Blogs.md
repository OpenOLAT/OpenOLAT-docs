## What are blogs?

The term "Blog" comprises "World Wide Web" and "Log." Blogs usually serve as
online journals for personal as well as professional information. By means of
blogs you can provide your course participants with texts, pictures or videos
in a swift and easy way. Entries will be displayed sorted by time; the latest
news will always be on top. Course participants can subscribe to blogs via RSS
Feed. They can also comment on entries and assess them.

A blog is generally used like a public diary. Its advantage is its quick,
standardized publication.
