## Toolbar

Each learning resource has a toolbar that provides access to various tools and
settings. Which of the following actions is possible depends on your access
authorization and on the learning resource type. You can access the toolbar
from both the learning resource and the information page.

Examples of a course and a test toolbar:

The "Administration" drop-down menu provides all the tools for configuring and
setting up a learning resource and is quite extensive. Die genauen
MÃ¶glichkeiten variieren je nach Lernressource.
