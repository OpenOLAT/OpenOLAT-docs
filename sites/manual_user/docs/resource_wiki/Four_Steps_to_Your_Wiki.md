2| Check course element before clicking on "Next."  
3| In the pull-down menu select "All registered OpenOlat users" in the section
"Modify course access."  
4| Click on "Finish."  
  
Now your Wiki is embedded and course participants can read your Wiki contents,
edit pages already existing, and create new pages.

Alternatively, a Wiki can be created like all other learning resources in the
author area and then integrated into the desired course. This procedure is
recommended to understand that learning resources are cross-course tools and
that the integration into the selected course is only one possibility. The
same Wiki can be included in several OLAT courses and can also be used
independently of the course.
