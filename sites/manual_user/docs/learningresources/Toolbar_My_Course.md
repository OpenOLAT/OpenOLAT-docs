### Evidence of achievement {: #evidence_of_achievement}

A performance record is a confirmation of a completed performance assessment and must first be activated by the course owner. Learners can then see the individual assessment modules of the course that they have completed, such as tests, assignments, etc., their scores, and further information.

![Leistungsnachweis](assets/Leistungsnachweis_19.png)

If a [certificate](../learningresources/Course_Settings_Assessment.md#certificate) has been issued for the course, you will also find it under "Performance record" for download. Course coaches can view the certificates in the [Coaching Tool](../area_modules/Coaching.md).

For certificates issued automatically after successful completion of a course, you will receive an automatically generated notification by email.

!!! info "Info"

    You can find transcripts and certificates from **all** your courses in the personal menu under [“Transcripts”](../personal_menu/Personal_Tools.md#transcripts).

### To dos  {: #to-dos}

Here, participants can see all the relevant to-dos for the course. 
These may be automatically generated to-dos from the [task course elements](../learningresources/Course_Element_Task.md). You will then be asked to take a specific step in the task process, e.g., select a task, submit a solution, or similar. 
On the other hand, teachers can assign specific tasks to all course participants or just to individual people. Learners can change the status of a task once they have completed the action. 

The to-dos serve as guidance for users on what currently needs to be done in the course. 
Users can find an overview of all personal and course-related to-dos in the ["Personal Tools"] section. There, they can also create their own to-dos.
