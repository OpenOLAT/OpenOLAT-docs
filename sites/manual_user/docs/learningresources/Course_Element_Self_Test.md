# Course Element "Self-test" {: #course_element_self_test}

![test icon](assets/test.png)

Like the "Test", the course element "Self-test" uses the learning resource
Test and is configured and set up similarly. The main difference is that there
is no option "passed/failed" and the tab "Highscore" is omitted.

In contrast to the course element "Test" self-tests are suitable to get
practice; results of self-tests will be saved anonymously. Self-tests can be
taken as often as needed. The course element "Self-test" contains learning
resources of the type "Test." If you have not generated a test before please
follow the instructions in the chapter ["Four Steps to Your Test or Self-
test"](../tests/Four_Steps_to_Your_Test_or_Self-test.md).

For more information on tests, refer to the chapter "[Creating Tests](../learningresources/Configure_tests.md)". 
The chapter "[Tests at course level](../learningresources/Tests_at_course_level.md)" is particularly relevant here.
