Like the "Test", the course element "Self-test" uses the learning resource Test and is configured and set up similarly. The main difference is that there is no option "passed/failed" and the tab "Highscore" is omitted.

In contrast to the course element "Test" self-tests are suitable to get practice; results of self-tests will be saved anonymously. Self-tests can be taken as often as needed.

The course element "Self-test" contains learning resources of the type "Test." If you have not generated a test before please follow the instructions in the chapter "[How do I proceed when I create a test](../../manual_how-to/test_creation_procedure/test_creation_procedure.md)".

For more information on tests, refer to the chapter "[Configure tests](../learningresources/Configure_tests.md)". The chapter "[Tests at course level](../learningresources/Tests_at_course_level.md)" is particularly relevant here.

A more complex alternative to the self-test is the course element "Practice".
