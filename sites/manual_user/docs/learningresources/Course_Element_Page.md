## Profile

Name | Page
---------|----------
Icon | ![Page Icon](assets/page.png){ class=size24 }
Available since | Release 18
Functional group | Knowledge Transfer
Purpose | Display of different content in a block-based layout
Assessable | no
Specialty / Note | Editing in a block-based editor is used in form learning resources and portfolio entries in addition to the course element page.

## Example

=== "Course view"
    
    There are different layout variants to choose from, in which the desired elements such as images, texts, tables and videos can be flexibly placed and thus the entire page can be designed.

    ![course_element_page_run_view_de.png](../learningresources/assets/course_element_page_run_view_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

=== "Edit mode"

    In contrast to the HTML editor (course element "HTML page"), the display in the block-based content editor already largely corresponds to the preview.

## Create page content

The course element page is added in the course editor and configured in the tabs.
Open the editor in **tab "Page content"** .

![Kursbaustein Seit im Kurseditor](assets/KB_Seite_Tab_Seiteninhalt19.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

The **Content Editor** will open. First, add a new layout. (More of these layouts can be added).

![course_element_page_tab_layout1_v1_de.png](assets/course_element_page_tab_layout1_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

One or more **content elements** can be added in each field of a layout.

## Edit page (Edit mode)

### Edit layout

To edit a layout, select the layout. An associated frame is displayed. In the upper right corner you will see icons with editing options.

Once a layout is selected, the arrangement of the content elements can also be changed later by clicking the gear icon and selecting a different layout arrangement.

Existing content elements are preserved and can be moved to new layout fields.

### Edit content elements

A content element can be changed by selecting it with a mouse click and using the buttons in the upper left corner.

![course_element_page_contentelement_title_v1_de.png](assets/course_element_page_contentelement_title_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

* **Cogwheel-Icon:** opens popup with editing options
* **3 Points:** Deleting the current element, inserting additional content elements
* **Arrow cross:** Move within the layout (also to other fields)


## Media storage

The inserted media is not stored as with the [course element "HTML page"](../learningresources/Course_Element_HTML_Page.md) in the [storage folder](../learningresources//Storage_folder.md) of the course but in the [Media Center](../personal_menu/Media_Center.md). Here you will find all installed media and can also regulate further management and release. 

Uploading media to the Media Center is done in the personal menu or in the Content Editor when creating a new content item.
