## Add and edit posts {: #blog_blogging_add_posts}

!!! info "Requirements"

    In order for you as a course participant or coach not only to comment and rate, but also to write your own contributions, it must first be permitted by the course owner. (See also [Blog Configuration](../learningresources/Blog_Configuration.md))<br>
    Please also note that **external** blogs inserted via a link cannot be edited.

Add your own entry by using the "Add entry" button.<br>


**Title:** Enter a title that describes the blog entry. This field is mandatory.

**Description:** The description is optional and is used as a preview of an article or entry. It can therefore also be a short introduction or summary.

**Content:** The content is the actual blog entry. This field should therefore be filled in. Formatting and images are permitted.

**Date and time of publication:** The date and time of publication are used to make the entry visible to other users or to hide it. If the time of publication is in the past, the entry will be visible. However, if it is in the future, it is a planned publication of the entry.

You can make the entry accessible to others by clicking on "Publish" (from the date specified). If you want to continue working on your entry at a later date, click on "Save draft". "Cancel" discards your changes and closes the form window. Drafts are highlighted in yellow in the list of entries. Planned publications are highlighted in green. All other entries are public and visible to others.

You can either publish the new entry directly, select the date of publication or save the entry as a draft.

To reopen and edit, select the option under the 3 dots or click on the title in the list view. In the course run, you will find an "Edit" link for each of your contributions.

## Moderating a blog {: #blog_blogging_moderate}

Moderating a blog means directing or intervening in communication. In a blog, this means that a person checks whether the posts are appropriate or whether they need to be corrected or possibly even deleted. Moderators of an OpenOlat blog have the rights to read, comment, edit, delete and create new entries. Moderators can also customize the title and description of the entire feed. 

The role of moderator can be taken on by course owners in any case. However, the right to act as moderator can also be assigned to coaches or specific persons. (See also [Blog configuration](../learningresources/Blog_Configuration.md))

!!! note "Note"

    If blog entries have been imported, they can only be deleted by moderators, owners or supervisors. (The original authors are still displayed as the creators of the posts).
