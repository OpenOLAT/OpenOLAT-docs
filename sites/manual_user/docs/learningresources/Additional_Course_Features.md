# Additional Course Features

In the course users have a number of additional course functions at their disposal, which the course author can activate and deactivate as required. 
These functions then appear either in the toolbar or under “My course”. 

## Menu "My course"

The drop down menu "My course" provides access to personalized course functions. 

![Dropdown - Mein Kurs](assets/Mein_Kurs_menue_19en.jpg)

Depending on the course configuration, it is possible that not all
options are available.  

 * **Evidence of achievement** displays your assessments in the course in table form and, if activated, gives access to the certificate of the course.*
 * **To-dos**: Displays the current to-dos of the course. 
  * **Notes**: Here you can enter course-specific notes that only you as a course participant can read. 
  * **Bookmark**: Bookmarked courses can be found in the "Courses" section in the "Favourites" tab.
  **Consent**: If there are specific terms of use and/or a course-related privacy policy in the course that you have agreed to, you can view them here and also revoke your consent. 
  * **Groups**: Here you can see all course-specific groups in which you are a member.
  * **Leave course**: With "Leave course" you can sign out of the course.


###  Evidence of Achievement & Certificate

An evidence of achievement is a confirmation of an existing efficiency control, e.g. taken tests or assessed tasks and must first be activated by the course owner. Learners can then see the individual assessment modules completed in the course, such as tests or tasks, their points and further information.

![evidence of achievement](assets/evidence_of_achievement_19.jpg)

If a certificate has been issued for this course, you will find it alongside the evidence of achievement details, ready for download. Coaches can view the certificates in the [Coaching-Tool](../area_modules/Coaching.md).

Once a certificate is automatically issued after successfully completing a course, you will receive an automatically generated email notification.

!!! info 

    All your evidences of achievement and certificates will be listed in your ["Evidence of achievements"](../personal_menu/Personal_Tools.md#evidences-of-achievement). It always opens in a new window and is printable.

### To-dos
Hier werden Teilnehmenden alle für Sie relevanten To-dos des Kurses angezeigt. 
Dabei kann es sich zum einen um automatisch generierte To-dos aus den Aufgaben-Kursbausteinen handeln. Dann werden aufgefordert einen bestimmten Schritt im Aufgabenflow zu gehen, z.B. eine Aufgabe auszuwählen, eine Lösung abzugeben o.ä. 
Zum anderen können Lehrende allen Kursteilnehmenden oder auch nur einzelnen Personen bestimmte konkrete To-dos zuweisen. Lernende können den Status eines To-dos ändern, wenn sie die Aktion erledigt haben. 

Die To-dos dienen dem User als Orientierung, was aktuell im Kurs zu tun ist. 
Ein Überblick über alle persönlichen und kursbezogenen To-dos finden User im Bereich ["Persönliche Werkzeuge"](../personal_menu/To-Dos.de.md). Dort können sie auch eigene To-dos ergänzen.  

### Leave course

The "Leave course" function immediately ends either your course or group membership, depending on how you gained access to the course. Subsequently, access to the course will be denied. In order to gain access to the course again, you will have to contact the respective course or group coach.

Attention: The possibility to unsubscribe from a course has to be activated by the course owner in the access configuration and is only valid for course participants and not for tutors or owners.


## Elements of the toolbar

The tools are available in the toolbar independently of specific releases within the course structure.

By default the [course info](../learningresources/Info_page.md) is visible in the toolbar. 

For learning path courses, the “Learning path” element also appears in the toolbar. Here users can see their progress in the course in a more differentiated way and thus get a good overview of completed and still to be completed course elements. 

![Mein Lernpfad](assets/Mein_Lernpfad.png)

Here is a **quick overview** of the toolbar tools available after activation by the course owner. 

 * Course search: Search the course by keywords  
 * Course calendar: Access to the course-specific calendar
  * Participant list: Overview of course members
  * Participant information: The coach can store central course information here (notifications)
  * E-mail: Pre-configured by the coach to send e-mails to course owners, supervisors and/or participants
  * BigBlueButton (or other virtual classrooms): For synchronous meetings
  * Blog: Access to a central course blog
  * Wiki: Access to a central Wiki for the course
  * Forum: Access to a central course forum
  * Documents: Access to a central documents folder
  * Glossary: Access to the glossary of the course if a glossary has been linked to the course
  * [Course chat](../basic_concepts/Chat.md): For the synchronous exchange of course members
 
  

### Course Calendar

The calendar opens in a new window. Only course authors are allowed to add events to the course calendar. Course calendars are automatically added to your [personal calendar](../personal_menu/Personal_Tools.md#PersonalMenu-_pers_kalender). Just select the course calendar from your personal calendar list. Information on the calendar list and further course functions can be found in the chapter [calendar](../personal_menu/Calendar.md).

###   Glossary {: #glossary}

If your course author has included a glossary to clarify terms in your course you will see the glossary drop-down menu at the top of the course toolbar. You can open that glossary in a new window or show the terms in your course. If a term in your course (e.g. in Wiki) is mentioned that is listed in the glossary, you will see its definition when you move your mouse over that term. The glossary can also be printed.

You may also be able to edit glossary entries if this option has been activated by the teacher. Further information can be found [here](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md).
