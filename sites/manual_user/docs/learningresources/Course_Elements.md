# Types of Course Element

In this chapter course authors learn in detail which course elements are
available in OpenOlat courses and how to configure them. If you have not yet
created a course, follow the instructions in the chapter "[Creating
courses](../learningresources/Creating_Course.md)" first.

!!! info "Info"

    All course elements have the tabs " **Title and description** " and "**Layout** ". In addition, there are certain tabs that are available throughout, depending on the technical course type.

    Please note: In addition to the course elements, OpenOlat courses also offer
    other tools and learning resources that can be used to design courses. You
    will find information on this in the respective chapters.

## Working With Course Elements

In the following you will find a list of the most important course elements
your course can be composed of. Probably not all course elements will be used
in your course since it is part of didactic creation of learning environments
and courses to specifically select functionalities and course elements. It is
possible that your course offers several course elements of the same type or
the course elements are named differently than in this list.

For conventional courses, you can use the icons shown to identify the course
element type. For learning path courses, no icons are displayed.


More detailed descriptions of the functionality of the following course
elements can be found on separate pages:

* [Forum](Working_with_Forums.md)
* [Group Task](Working_with_Tasks_and_Group_Tasks.md)
* [Self-Test](Working_with_Tests.md)
* [Task](Working_with_Tasks_and_Group_Tasks.md)
* [Test](Working_with_Tests.md)
* [Topic Assignment](Working_with_Topic_Assignment.md)
* [Wiki](Working_with_Wiki.md)


### Assessment

![](assets/manual_score.png)

Here you receive points or a "passed" or "failed" from your coach. You can
also receive comments and feedback documents as well as rubric feedback in
this way. The course element is often used when evaluating actions that have
not been submitted online in OpenOlat before, e.g. presentations or real
products.

  

### Appointment scheduling

![](assets/dateentry.png)

This way, your teacher can provide you with various dates to choose from or to
enroll directly. You can select the date(s) that suits you by clicking on the
? button. Depending on the configuration, there may be a deadline for the
entry.

### Blog {: #blog}

![](assets/blog.png)

Similar to a podcast a blog serves to provide new content. You can include
text as well as pictures or movies in your contributions.

Each OpenOlat user has the right to assess or comment on blog entries. Such
entries can be assessed by means of 1 - 5 stars. In order to write a comment
or read other entries you should click on the link "Comments." It is also
possible to see assessments of other blog readers.

Blog entries can only be _created_ if a course author has provided his
authorization. Just click on "Create new entries" to write a new blog entry.

 Create and edit blog entries

 **Title:** Indicate a title to describe your blog entry. This field is
mandatory.

 **Description:** Your description is optional and will be used as preview of
your article or entry. Therefore you could also add a short introduction or
summary here.

 **Content:** Content equates to blog entry. This field is therefore
mandatory. Formatting and images are allowed.

 **Time and date of publication:** Date and time of publication serve to hide
your entry from other users or to put it on display. If a publication date
lies in the past your entry will be visible. If it lies in the future your
entry is scheduled for publication.

You can make your entry accessible by clicking on "Publish" (starting from the
date indicated). If you want to interrupt and continue to write your entry
later on just click on "Save draft." By clicking on "Cancel" your
modifications will be discarded before closing the form's window. Drafts in
the entry list will be highlighted in yellow. Scheduled publications in green.
All other entries are open to the public and therefore visible.

You can either publish this entry directly, determine a date for its
publication or save your entry as a draft.

Subscribe the RSS Feed of your blog if you do not want to miss any new
entries.

### Calendar

![](assets/calendar.png)

The course element "Calendar" offers an alternative view on the [course
calendar](Additional+Course+Features.html#AdditionalCourseFeatures-
_kurskalender) that can be called up at the top of the course toolbar if
activated. A course author can predefine a date for your calendar view, e.g. a
particular week, and appoint a time for certain events during that week.

### Checklist

![](assets/checklist.png)

Achieved goals, missing tasks, right or wrong solutions - checklists make this
visible and can therefore be evaluated by the supervisor.

As an informational work aid, which supports users in completing smaller tasks
or keeping information secure, the checklist allows the maintenance of e.g.
to-do or check lists. Thus, for example, tasks outside of OpenOlat can also be
documented. If this is the case, you may find information on the evaluation on
the start page of the checklist.

Once a checklist has been assigned a submission date, it can no longer be
edited afterwards. Below the submission date and the evaluation information,
you will find the actual list with all checkboxes, including any information
and files for download. If a checkbox is greyed out, it can either only be
checked by the supervisor, or the submission date has already passed.

### Enrolment  
![](assets/enrolment.png)

By means of the course element "Enrolment" you can register for one or more
groups of a course. In OpenOlat groups can be used for different purposes,
e.g. for work groups or for distributing course participants.

Just click on that link "Enrolment" to become a member of a group. Depending
on your configuration you can either enroll in one group only or in several at
once. After enrolling you will see links to the corresponding course groups
you are a member of in the drop-down menu "My course" on your right.

In some groups the number of members is limited. If the group is full, there
may be a waiting list, depending on the configuration. If the group
administrator has set this up you will automatically move up as soon as a
group member signs out of the group.

Often you can unsubscribe from the group at the same place where you signed
up. If this is not the case, the group administrator has forbidden you to
unsubscribe and you must contact him if you have accidentally signed up.

### E-mail

![](assets/contact.png)

This function is a kind of contact form. Depending on the configuration,
e-mails can be sent here to all course owners, all coaches, all participants
or participants from certain groups. Fill in the fields "Subject" and
"Message" and send the e-mail via OpenOlat.

### Folder

![](assets/folder.png)

In the course element "Folder" coaches can provide files for download. By
default course elements folders are configured in a way that only course
authors are allowed to upload files and course participants are only allowed
to read or download files.

Subscribe to that folder to be notified in case of new documents. You will be
notified by e-mail or under "Subscriptions" in OpenOlat.

If course participants are also allowed to upload files they will find a
corresponding link on their top right. In order to store those files in a
structured way you can then create subfolders and also delete files. If you
want to prevent others from deleting your files you should click on the icon
"[Meta data](../basic_concepts/Full_Text_Search.md#Full-TextSearch-_metadata)" in the table
view and lock the file. Locked files are marked with a lock.

![](assets/folder_locked.png)

Attention, don't mix them up: In addition to the download folders in courses,
learners also have access to [Personal folders](../personal_menu/Personal_folders.md), that
can be used for individual learning independent of the course. Furthermore
there is the course element "Participant folder" (see below).  

### Participant Folder

![](assets/pfolder_434343_64.png)

Here learners can make files available to the instructors and also receive
feedback from the instructor via the return folder. If the administrator has
activated an appropriate document editor, it is also possible to create
different file formats such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint files directly in
OpenOlat. Each course participant only sees his own individual folder here. In
contrast to the course element "Folder" (see above) submissions by other
learners are not visible in the participant folder.

Points or passed/not passed will not be processed.

### Participant List

![](assets/group.png)

The list of participants gives an overview of the people who have access to
the course. Depending on the settings the course owners (course
administrators), coaches, and/or participants are displayed. Via the list of
participants you can also access the visiting card of the displayed persons.
Depending on the information stored there by OpenOlat members you will receive
further information and can also contact them via synchronous chat. If
configured, you can also send e-mails to all or selected participants or
download or print the entire participant list.

### Podcast {: #podcast}

![](assets/podcast.png)

A podcast provides information in the form of audio or video files. You can
listen to or view these so-called episodes directly in OpenOlat, on the one
hand, and subscribe to podcasts, download the episodes to local portals such
as iTunes and copy them to your mobile device, on the other.

In order to create new episodes you have to be authorized by a course author.
Click then on "Add episode" to create a new podcast episode.

 Create or edit episode

Please indicate a title to describe this episode accurately. This field is
mandatory. This description is optional. If there is need to further explain
your media file you can do that here.

An episode always contains one audio and one video file. Select these on your
PC to be uploaded afterwards. Depending on the file's size this can take some
time. Please note that only Flash compatible formats are allowed (such as FLV,
MP4, MP3, M4V, M4A, and AAC).

By clicking on "Publish" this episode will be added to your podcast. Other
users will have access.

Each OpenOlat user has the right to comment on episodes and to assess them by
means of 1 - 5 stars. In order to write a comment or read other comments you
should click on the link "Comments."

Subscribe to the RSS Feed of your podcast if you do not want to miss any new
episodes.

### Portfolio Task

![](assets/portfolio_434343_64.png)

If your coach provides you with a pre-structured portfolio of tasks or calls
for action, you can pick them up here. Click on " Collect portfolio task" to
view the task and solve the required tasks in the predefined binder. If the
coach has hardly defined any structures and restrictions, you can design the
binder as you wish, otherwise the predefined structure forms the framework for
further processing. It is possible that the coach has defined a deadline that
you should note.

In the portfolio task, you can, for example, document and reflect on your
learning process or carry out editing over a longer period of time.

Once you have collected the portfolio task in the course, you will also find
it in your [personal menu](../personal_menu/Personal_Tools.md) under "Portfolio 2.0" - "My
portfolio binders".

To hand in a solution, publish your assignment and [give access
rights](../area_modules/Shared_by_me.md). Further information to the editing of a portfolio
task you will find
[here](../learningresources/Portfolio_task_and_assignment_Collecting_and_editing.md).

### Questionnaire, Survey

![](assets/formular_434343_64.png)

Questionnaires are used for evaluations or opinion polls. Each questionnaire
can only be filled in once. The questionnaire results are normally stored
anonymously. The questionnaire appears directly when the corresponding course
element is called. You can also save a questionnaire temporarily. Just fill
out the provided fields.

  

### Video

![](assets/video_64_0_434343_none.png)

The course element Video gives you access to a video and depending on the
settings you can also comment on this video and rate it with an asterisk. If
the video is interactive it is also possible to perform further actions such
as answering quiz questions or calling up links.

### Virtual Classrooms

![](assets/virtual_class.png)

With the course elements [Adobe Connect](../learningresources/Course_element_Adobe_Connect.md),
[GoToMeeting](../learningresources/Course_element_GoToMeeting.md),
[Vitero](../learningresources/Course_element_vitero.md) BigBllueButton and
[OpenMeetings](../learningresources/Course_element_OpenMeetings.md), different [virtual
classrooms](../course_elements/Virtual_classrooms.md) can be used in OpenOlat for synchronous
meetings, video conferences or webinars. Which course element will be
integrated and which functionalities will be available depends on which
configuration your OpenOlat system administrator has selected.

A virtual room allows you to work online (synchronously) with several people
who are geographically separated from you. Functions of virtual rooms include
live chat, audio and video, desktop and document sharing. When entering a
virtual room by means of a course element a new browser window will open in
which the virtual session will take place.

To be able to use all functionalities you will need a headset and a connected
camera. Depending on your system you might have to download additional
software temporarily.

## Knowledge Transfer

### Course Element: Structure {: #structure}

![structure icon](assets/structure.png)

The course element " Structure" serves to arrange your course. By default it
offers an automatic overview of all sub-elements along with short title,
title, and description. Use this course element to arrange your course content
and/or to clearly separate your modules. Further information can be found
[here](Course_Element_Structure.md).

###  Course Element: Single Page {: #single_page}

![single page icon](assets/single_page.png)

In the course element "Single page" you can integrate various files directly
into the course structure. These web-specific files (pdf, html) can already be
in the folder of the course or a linked resource folder or can be created
directly with the course editor as HTML page. The web files linked in this way
are displayed directly in the course structure in contrast to a provision via
the course element "Folder". The course element "Single Page" is particularly
suitable for the provision of quickly visible information and hypertext-based
content. Further information on the course elements "Single Page" and
"Multiple Single Pages" can be found
[here](Course_Element_Single_Page.md).

###  Course Element: External Page {: #external_page}

![external page icon](assets/external_page.png)

With the help of the course element "External page" you can call up an
external website. Simply enter the desired URL in the configuration in the tab
"Page content" to integrate the external page into your course navigation. For
the display of the linked page, the variants

  * "Embedded (source hidden)",
  * "Embedded (source visible)",
  * "New browser window" (source visible) and
  * "Integrated completely (source hidden)

are offered.

For pages that require authentication and whose source is hidden, you can
activate "Page pass-word controlled" and enter the corresponding values in the
"User" and "Password" fields.

It is recommended to use this course element when planning to include pages
containing database queries (e.g. research tools, online exercises, etc.). It
is only possible to link external pages via HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

#### External page: configuration

**URL:** You have to fill in this field. Here you indicate the site on which the desired external learning contents can be found (e.g._http://www.server.com/page.html_).

**Configure display:** You can choose between four options:

*  _Integrated completely (source hidden):_ The external HTML page will be parsed and integrated in your OLAT page completely. HTML pages may only contain resources such as images, Flash, videos or links with **relative paths**. Absolute relative paths such as "/public" (relative to a bsic URI) or absolute paths such as "http://..." are not allowed.

*  _Embedded (source hidden):_ The external HTML page will be included in a so-called «iframe« The external page's Internet address will not be visible. HTML pages may only contain resources such as images, Flash, videos or links with **relative paths**. Absolute relative paths such as "/public" (relative to a bsic URI) or absolute paths such as "http://..." are not allowed.

*  _Embedded (source visible):_ This also means including your external HTML page in a «iframe« The source code of the OLAT page will show you the external page's Internet address.

*  _New browser window (source visible):_ Another option is the possibility to display your external page in its own browser window.

By selecting the upper two options OLAT will transfer username and password in case your external page requests this.

Embedded frames («iframe«) resemble single browser windows, however, they are part of the initial window's HTML page.

Advantage of using an «iframe« : you can show any content in OLAT (e.g.complex web pages in nested frames, mathML etc.).

Disadvantage of using an «iframe« : your content might appear along with its own scroll bar.

!!! info "Info"

    If you are not sure which variant is the right one for your case, start with the option "Integrated completely" and test the other display options until the linked page is displayed as desired.

###  Course Element: CP Learning Content {: #CP_learning_content}

![icon cp learning content](assets/content.png)

Use the course element "CP Learning Content" to integrate learning content in
IMS-CP format (IMS-CP Version 1.1.2) into your course. You can either create
the CP directly in OpenOlat, which is explained in the chapter "[Five steps to your content packaging](../resource_cp/In_Five_Steps_to_Your_Content_Package.md)". Or you
can create the CP externally, for example with [eLML](http://www.elml.org
"eLML ").

Further information on the CP can be found
[here](../resource_cp/index.md).

###  Course Element: SCORM Learning Content {: #SCORM_learning_content}

![icon scorm learning content](assets/scorm.png)

Using the course element "SCORM Learning Content", externally created SCORM
packages can be integrated into OpenOlat courses. SCORM is a standard with
which content as well as interactive e-learning modules can be encapsulated
and integrated into different systems. Further information on the
configuration of the course element SCORM can be found in the chapter "[Course
element: SCORM learning
content](Course_Element_SCORM_Learning_Content.md)".

### Course Element: Document {: #document}

![icon document](assets/document_icon.jpg)

By means of the course element "Document" different document formats can be
integrated directly into the course. This course element is especially
suitable for Office documents, PDF or the display of graphic files. It is
possible to access already existing files or to upload or create new files.
Word processing documents and PDF are directly displayed by using the
integrated Document Viewer.

Files that are located in the course's storage folder or uploaded as separate
learning resource can be used. Which file formats can be newly created depends
on the settings in the administration of the respective OpenOlat instance.

The integrated documents can later be edited, exchanged or saved as a separate
learning resource. Depending on the file type, other options such as editing
metadata are also possible. Editing of text documents is also possible when
the corresponding licenses are activated in the OpenOlat Administration, the
editor then opens in a separate window.

Furthermore you can set user rights for your course element in the course
editor and thus define which roles are allowed to edit and download the
respective document (if possible).

The height of the display area can also be defined.

After downloading a corresponding document, the metadata shows who edited the
document last.

!!! warning "Note"

    For video files the course element "Video" should be used and for HTML pages the course element "Single page".

###  Course Element: Folder {: #folder}

![icon folder](assets/folder.png)

In the course element "Folder" you can offer files for download. The course
element folder is often used to provide course materials such as slides or
scripts. In addition, the course element "Folder" can also be configured as a
collaborative tool for the learner's file upload.

Further information on the configuration and use of the course element
"Folder" can be found [here](Course_Element_Folder.md).

###  Course Element: Podcast {: #podcast}

![icon podcast](assets/podcast.png)

The course element "Podcast" can either be used to easily provide others with
your own audio and video files or with external podcast episodes in OpenOlat.
Course participants can see episodes directly within OpenOlat; or they can
subscribe to podcasts, upload those by means of online services such as iTunes
before copying them to a mobile device.

How to [create](../resource_podcast/Four_Steps_to_Your_Podcast.md) and
[configure](../learningresources/Podcast_Further_Configurations.md) a podcast is explained in
separate chapters.

###  Course Element: Blog {: #blog}

![icon blog](assets/blog.png)

Via the "Blog" you can inform the participants of the course about current
topics in the form of text, pictures or video. You can integrate external
blogs as well as create and use a new OLAT learning resource "Blog". Course
owners can, for example, maintain a blog more or less regularly in a blog and
thus inform course participants about new current content on the event topic.
Participants can then comment on these contributions and rate them with 1-5
stars. It is also possible to give course participants the right to write a
blog, so that they can jointly run a course blog.

How to [create](../resource_blog/Four_Steps_to_Your_Blog.md) and
[configure](../learningresources/Blog_Further_Configurations.md) a blog is explained on
separate pages.

###  Course Element: Video {: #video}

![icon video](assets/video_64_0_434343_none.png)

With the course element "Video" you can add self-made videos or videos
imported via a URL, which are available as learning resource video in OLAT, to
your course. One video per course element is linked. The video can be
annotated and evaluated and thus optimally integrated into the learning and
teaching process of a course.

Further information about the course element video can be found
[here](../learningresources/Course_Element_Video.md). Information on postprocessing the
video with OLAT Quiz and jump marks can be found in chapter "[Learning
Resource: Video](../learningresources/Learning_resource_Video.md)".

  
 
###  Course Element: Video Livestream {: #livestream}

  

###  Course Element: Opencast  {: #opencast}

With the course element Opencast, recordings of meetings and courses that are
stored on an Opencast server can be integrated into OpenOlat courses. The
configuration and connection of the Opencast server is done in the
administration. In the course element either single videos or whole series can
be integrated.

###  Course Element: edu-sharing {: #edusharing}

  

###  Course Element: card2brain {: #card2brain}

![icon c2b](assets/card2brain_434343_64.png)

The course element card2brain allows learning with flashcards. To use this
course element an enterprise login of card2brain is compulsory. Clients of
frentix please contact
[card2brain@](mailto:card2brain@frentix.com)[frentix.com](http://frentix.com)[.](mailto:contact@frentix.com.)
Non-clients please contact [card2brain](http://card2brain.ch/info/contact)
directly.

###  Course Element: Edubase {: #edubase_config}

![icon edubase](assets/edubas_icon.png)

This course element allows you to link to e-books from Edubase. The e-books
can then be opened in OpenOlat.

A prerequisite for using this course element is an Edubase account, plus the
allowance to use a specific e-book. Clients of frentix please contact
[edubase@frentix.com](mailto:edubase@frentix.com)[.](mailto:contact@frentix.com.)
Non-clients please contact [Edubase](https://www.edubase.ch/) directly.

!!! info "Info"

    The module must first be activated and configured in the administration, and authorization keys for the eBooks are also required. As soon as the pre- settings are done, the course element can be added in OpenOlat. By using the editor, you can define specific reading orders for the users for an embedded e-book.

![Edubase Screen](assets/Edubase_EN.png)

## Assessment

Here you get an overview of the course elements that can be used for knowledge
testing. For some course elements there are separate pages or chapters here in
the manual.


![assessment icon](assets/Wissensueberpruefung_172_en.png)

OpenOlat provides various course elements for knowledge testing. The central
course elements for this are the three course elements for OpenOlat
[tests](../learningresources/Configure_tests.md) and the two course elements for [submission tasks](../task/index.md). But also the other elements such as [portfolio task](../learningresources/Creating_Portfolio_Tasks.md),
[assessments](Course_Element_Assessment.md) with and without
evaluation grid (rubric) or the checklists offer a lot of potential for
certain scenarios.

Most course elements in the assessment category can also be given points if
required and then will be given the "Highscore" configuration tab. With the
allocation of points, further features such as the addition of points or the
passing/failing of a course based on the assessments of different course
elements can be added. A course element [structure](Knowledge_Transfer.md#course-element-structure--structure)
is used for this.

Another configuration tab that is available for most assessment course
elements (except for self-test and survey) is the tab "Reminder". Here,
e-mails can be sent depending on the progress of the respective course
element. For example, a mail can be sent if a task has not yet been worked on
by a certain date. The possibilities are similar to those in the menu
"Reminder" in the course administration for which you can find more
information [here](../learningresources/Course_Reminders.md).

The OpenOlat [questionnaire](../learningresources/Form_editor_Questionnaire_editor.md) or the course
element Survey can also be found in the assessment category.

  

###  Course Element: Assessment {: #course_element_assessment}

![assesment icon](assets/manual_score.png)

The course element "Assessment" is suitable for evaluating services which are
not explicitly submitted electronically, e.g. presence presentations or online
websites.

On separate pages you will learn how to set up, perform and configure an
[assessment](Course_Element_Assessment.md).

  

###  Course Element: Task {: #course_element_task}

![task icon](assets/task.png)

Coaches can use the Task course element to organize actions and submission
tasks. Learners upload their submissions to the OpenOlat course and receive
feedback or assessment from the teacher. Revisions can also be requested.
Sample solutions can also be provided using this course element.

The central configuration of the course element takes place in the first step
in the tab "Workflow". Here you determine which of the following options you
want to use:

   *  **Task Assignment**: assign tasks to course participants or groups.

  *  **Submission**: Learners should have the opportunity to submit tasks. This is where course participants create their solutions or upload them in a PDF file format.

  *  **Review and Correction**: this is where course participants will find their tasks corrected as well as requests for revisions.

  *  **Revision Period**: course participants upload their revised documents in this element. You as a coach can place multiple revision requests until the task is considered completed and the revision process closed.

  *  **Sample solution**: provide course participants with sample solutions of their tasks. You can either create them directly in OpenOlat or upload files.

  *  **Assessment**: create individual assessments for each course participant or for participants of a group as a whole.

 In the tab "Learning path" (or in the tab "Workflow" for conventional) you can also define whether the task is mandatory or voluntary. 

Mandatory tasks have to be completed and will be collected after the set deadline and handed over to the coach for evaluation. In the case of optional tasks, the user can decide for himself if he wants to work on them. Furthermore, optional tasks are not collected after the deadline.

!!! info "Info"

    How to create tasks step by step and further information on other [configuration possibilities](../learningresources/Task_Further_Configurations.md) can be found in the chapter ["Creating Tasks"](Course_Element_Task).

###  Course Element: Portfolio Task {: #course_element_portfolio}

![portfolio_434343_64.png](../assets/portfolio_434343_64.png)

By means of the course element "Portfolio task" you can provide predefined
portfolio templates to be filled by your course participants. The course
participants can then pick up the portfolio task in their course, 
and are then forwarded to their individual portfolio area. The portfolio picked up in this way can then be filled with content and artifacts by the learners and, if desired, made available to other people or the course supervisors. Depending on the configuration, these persons can also evaluate and comment on the portfolio. 
 
For the course element Portfolio task you need a "Portfolio 2.0 template",
which you link to the course element. If you have not yet created a Portfolio
Template learning resource, you can also create a new Portfolio Template or
link to a previously created one directly in the course via "Select or create
Portfolio Template".  Click [here](../learningresources/Creating_Portfolio_Tasks.md) to find out
exactly how to create a portfolio task.


If you have already added a portfolio template, it will appear under Selected
Portfolio Template. Follow the link to get to the preview. You now have the
option of selecting a different content with the "Change Portfolio Template"
button.

!!! info

    In case a portfolio template has already been downloaded and edited it will no longer be possible to replace it.

In the tab "Evaluation" you can preconfigure the display of points, status
passed/failed and individual comments. In the fields "Note for all users" and
"Note for supervisors" you formulate general information for the evaluation to
all course participants and coaches.

Further information on how learners can pick up and use a portfolio task can
be found in the chapter "[Portfolio task and assignment: Collecting and editing](../learningresources/Portfolio_task_and_assignment_Collecting_and_editing.md)".
How teachers can evaluate a portfolio task can be found in the chapter
"[Portfolio assignment: Grading](../learningresources/Portfolio_assignment_Grading.md)".

How the portfolio component looks like from the students' point of view and
how it can be solved can be found in the chapter "Learning activities in the
course" under the item ["Portfolio task"](../learningresources/Portfolio_assignment_Grading.md).

General information on the subject of portfolios and e-portfolios can be found
[here](../area_modules/index.md).

### Course Element: Group Task {: #course_element_group_tasks}

![Task Icon](assets/task.png)

The course element Group task functions largely like the course element
[Task](../task/index.md). 

Points and feedbacks are created for the whole group in this course element, but can be customized.

The following differences to the course element Task should be noted:

When creating the group task, one or more groups to which the task is assigned
must be selected in the tab "Workflow". Only these groups can then view and
edit the task. As long as no group has been assigned, the course element is
not visible when the editor is closed.

When the editor is closed, the tab "All participants" does not show the
individual persons directly, but the assigned groups are shown, which can then
be selected and evaluated. Within the evaluation process it can be decided
whether the evaluation is valid for the entire group or whether the evaluation
is only valid for a certain group member.

###  Course Element: Test {: #course_element_test}

![test icon](assets/test.png)

The course element "Test" integrates tests into a course. A test in a course
is used to assess achievements and includes various question types. Depending
on the choice of question types, it is evaluated automatically or manually.
OpenOlat uses the IMS-QTI 2.1 format for tests, which allows exchange with
other test systems and learning management systems that also support this
standard.

If you have not selected any test yet, there will be a message saying _No file
chosen_ under the tab Test configuration. Click on "Choose, create or import
file" to add a test to the course element, or to create a new test,
respectively. In case you have already selected a test the name of this
learning resource will be displayed after _Selected file_. Click on the name
to open a preview of the test. Click on "Replace file" if you would like to
exchange the learning resource with another one. Further information can be
found in the chapter "[Creating Tests](../learningresources/Configure_tests.md)".

The two main tabs for test configuration are "[Test configuration](../learningresources/Tests_at_course_level.md)" and " **Options** ".

The settings under "Options" are initially being copied from the options of
the learning resource. However, the options can be adjusted if needed. To do
so, open the tab "Options" and click on "Adjust configuration". You may now
set a time limit, limit the number of attempts, allow guests to do the test,
choose from various display options, etc. If the option "Show question title"
is not selected while menu navigation is allowed, the navigation will only
show "anonymised" titles, not the real titles.

Furthermore, you can set up an information text (HTML page) which will be
visible at the test start page as "Information", above the "Start" button. To
add a file go to the tab "Options" and click on "Select page" or "Create page
and open in editor". You can replace the file later if needed.

Once you have selected a file, the security setting field is added to the
display and you can allow links to files in the storage folder. This is
useful, for example, if you want to link to other HTML files or graphics.
However, this setting also means that experienced course participants can view
the entire folder of the course.

Any test linked to a course can only be edited in your test-editor as long as
there are no users launching and taking it. After that only typing errors can
be corrected.

!!! attention

    In case participants are taking a test at that moment all their
    results will be lost since that test is not complete. All results achieved between replacing and publishing a test will be lost as well.

The test results of the participants will be personalised.
  

###  Course Element: Self-test {: #course_element_self_test}

![test icon](assets/test.png)

Like the "Test", the course element "Self-test" uses the learning resource
Test and is configured and set up similarly. The main difference is that there
is no option "passed/failed" and the tab "Highscore" is omitted.

In contrast to the course element "Test" self-tests are suitable to get
practice; results of self-tests will be saved anonymously. Self-tests can be
taken as often as needed. The course element "Self-test" contains learning
resources of the type "Test." If you have not generated a test before please
follow the instructions in the chapter ["Four Steps to Your Test or Self-
test"](../tests/Four_Steps_to_Your_Test_or_Self-test.md).

For more information on tests, refer to the chapter "[Creating Tests](../learningresources/Configure_tests.md)". 
The chapter "[Tests at course level](../learningresources/Tests_at_course_level.md)" is particularly relevant here.

Eine komplexere Alternative zum Selbsttest stellt der Kursbaustein Übung dar. 

### Course Element: Practice {: #course_element_uebung}

The course element with flashcard logic is used for individual self-testing of course participants. For this purpose, the teacher combines several OpenOlat tests or question sets from the question pool, which the learners can work on independently in series and challenges. The number of questions per exercise series can be defined, as can the number of total challenges. For example, if a series comprises 10 questions, the learner is shown 10 questions. Afterwards, he can decide whether he wants to answer incorrectly answered questions again or skip them. The number of levels reflects the intensity of the exercise and indicates how often a question has to be answered correctly repeatedly. 

![Course element practice](assets/KB_Uebung_en.png)

In addition to the practice settings configured by the teacher, course participants can also filter and edit specific questions such as new questions or questions of a certain level. Custom series can also be created.

After completion of a challenge, detailed statistics on the learning status as well as a summary overview are available in addition to the classification in ranking lists.

!!! info "Info"

    Only automatically evaluable test questions can be used for this course element. 

### Course Element: Video task
With the course element "Video task" video learning resources can be reused for interactive (formative) exercises or tasks with assessments (summative). Participants have to identify relevant situations ("teachable moment") in a video and assign them to a category.
Es steht ein Übungsmodus und ein scharfer Testmodus zur Verfügung. 

### Course Element: Form  {: #course_element_form}

![form icon](assets/Forular_icon.png)

Using the course element "Form" you can add the learning resource form to a
course. The form works similar to the course element "Survey" and can also be
filled out only once. However, with the form it is visible which participant
has filled in what in the form. Thus, in contrast to the survey (at least in
the standard setting), filling in the form is not anonymous. 

For the
completion of the course element, a last deadline can be defined in the tab
"Form". A [course reminder](../learningresources/Course_Reminders.md) can also be linked in
addition. In contrast to the survey module, participants automatically receive
a confirmation e-mail with the date and time of submission as well as their
completed form as a PDF attachment when they submit the completed form.

Coaches can see in the overview table in the course run which participants
have already completed the form and which have not. Forms that have already
been submitted can be reopened by the coach for further processing by the
participant, or they can be completely reset. By clicking on the participant,
the completed form can be viewed. The form data of all participants are
available as Excel export.

The use of this course element makes sense e.g. if the learners have to fill
in certain forms obligatorily, e.g. before starting a laboratory internship or
as confirmation for the independent performance of a service.

!!! Info 

    Anders als beim Kursbaustein Umfrage erfolgt für diesen Kursbaustein allerdings keine spezifische grafische Auswertungsübersicht. 

###  Course Element: Survey {: #course_element_survey}

![survey icon](assets/formular_434343_64.png)

With the course element "Survey" you can add an online questionnaire to your
course. Als Basis wird die Lernressource "Formular" verwendet und mit dem Kursbaustein Umfrage verknüpft. 
A questionnaire must
first be created with the learning resource "Form" in the author area. If you
have not yet created a questionnaire, follow the instructions in chapter "[3 steps to your questionnaire](../forms/Three_Steps_to_your_Form.md)". By default, the results are stored anonymously. 

A formular linked in a course can only be edited completely in the formular
editor as long as the page has not been opened. After that only typing errors
can be corrected.

!!! Note 

    If participants are currently running the questionnaire but have not yet completed it, their results will be lost.

Further information on the subject of questionnaires and surveys can be found
in the chapter "[Creating questionnaires](../learningresources/Form_editor_Questionnaire_editor.md)" and
the corresponding subchapters.


###  Course Element: Checklist {: #course_element_checklist}

![checklist.png](../assets/checklist.png)

The course element allows you to embed and evaluate checklists in the course
structure. A checklist contains check elements with completed and uncompleted
tasks or checks. The checklist can be used as an informational tool that helps
users to complete smaller tasks or to keep information secure, for example, by
maintaining attendance or to-do lists. It is the only module that the user or
course participant can complete as a self-assessment.

You can also add several checklists at once. This procedure is useful if you
need several identical checklists. Several (maximum of 12) modules with the
same check elements are created and bundled with a structure module. A title
is automatically created for each module, but changes are possible. Each
module can then be given a specific submission date.

In this way, several checklists with identical check criteria but for
different groups, for different objects to be checked, for different event
dates or for checking the same object at different times (development) can be
created relatively quickly.

Further information can be found
[here](Course_Element_Checklist.md).

  

####  Highscore  {: #highscore}

The highscore, except for the course element "practice" , can be added for all assessable course element as well as for
structure elements.

The highscore makes a playful comparison between test participants possible
and can be seen as motivational factor. The prerequisite for using the
"Highscore" tab is that points are awarded for the selected block (e.g. test,
task, evaluation).

First "Show Highscore" needs to be enabled. Optional a starting date can be
added. Upon this date the highscore will be shown. Otherwise the highscore is
shown directly after finishing the test. Afterword it can be defined, if the
user data is shown anonymized or with pre and last name. In the next part it
can be chosen, which elements of the highscore should be shown. There is the
choice between congratulation title, podium, histogram and top result listing.
For the listing it can be defined additionally, if all users or only a certain
number should be shown. At least one of the above options need to be selected.

![highscore](assets/Highscore_EN.png)

### Course Element: Wiki {: #wiki}
![Wiki icon](../assets/wiki_icon.png)

Use a Wiki to easily create learning content together with your course participants. A Wiki is suitable for doing group work; it can serve as documentation tool or as some sort of knowledge base for your studies and projects.

The course element "Wiki" helps you to embed a Wiki in your course. Just click on "Select, create or import Wiki" in the tab "**Wiki learning content**" to assign a Wiki already existing or to create a new one. The chapter ["Creating Wikis"](../resource_wiki/Four_Steps_to_Your_Wiki.md) will tell you how to do so step by step. If you have not already selected a Wiki yet the title **Selected Wiki** will show the message _No Wiki selected_.

If you have already added a Wiki its name will appear in the field. In order to change the assignment of a Wiki click on "Replace Wiki" in the tab "Wiki learning content" before selecting another Wiki.

In the tab "Wiki learning content" you configure the user permissions of the Wiki. Here you can set that not only owners but also maintainers and participants may edit Wiki articles. By default all course participants have read and write permission in a Wiki. Only that OpenOlat user who has created the page or OpenOlat users who are registered as owners in a wiki will be allowed to delete wiki pages.

In the chapter "Learning Activities in Courses" section ["Wiki"](../learningresources/Working_with_Wiki.md), you will find more information on how to adapt the Wiki syntax, how to create new pages, and how to view different versions of a Wiki page.

!!! warning "Attention"

    If you can't find the "Wiki" course element in the course editor, it was disabled by a system administrator.

###  Course Element: Forum {: #forum}
![Forum icon](../assets/forum_icon.png)

With the course element "Forum" you can easily enable asynchronous online discussions for different purposes in your course. For example, course participants could write posts with questions about the content of the course and answer each other's questions, or you could initiate a technical discussion or implement specific forum-based online methods. In the chapter "Learning Activities in Courses" you will get further information on opening topics and replying to questions; see section ["Forum"](../learningresources/Working_with_Forums.md). Generally all course participants have read and write permission in a forum. All course authors and tutors dispose of the option to moderate a forum additionally.

A course author can also use the forum to notify course participants in the short term. Just configure your forum in the tab "Access" accordingly, i.e. that only course authors have write permission.

!!! tip "Tip"

    Advise your course participants on subscribing to the forum to be up-to-date.
   
#### Tab Configuration
Here you can set the user rights of the forum and define which course roles are allowed to create forum posts. You can choose between coaches, participants and guests. You can also define whether coaches are allowed to moderate the forum and whether pseudonymized postings are allowed in the forum. In the case of pseudonymized forums, the posters can choose a pseudonym themselves. Once a pseudonym has been created, it will always remain active in the forum, but can be changed or switched off as required. The pseudonym can be protected by a user with a password, so that only this user can use this pseudonym. Without password protection the same pseudonym can be used by several users. Furthermore, it can be set that the use of a pseudonym is activated by default. To do this, select the checkbox "Pseudonym activated in individual forum posts".

![Configuration options for forum](assets/forum_config.png){ class="shadow" }

**Moderation rights**
All course owners and [coaches](../basic_concepts/coach.md) have the following additional moderation rights. You can:

  * Editing and deleting all posts in a forum; attaching files.
  * Prioritizing threads (sticky): a certain discussion subject will always appear on top of a list.
  * Closing discussion: it will no longer be possible to reply to a certain discussion subject.
  * Hiding discussion: a certain subject will no longer appear in the forum list.
  * Displaying discussion: hidden subject will be displayed anew.
  * Filter for persons: on the forum's overview page posts of every single course participant can be displayed.
  * Archiving forum: posts (as MS Word) and attached files will be zipped before storing them in your personal folder.

Persons with moderation rights can also move forum topics or individual posts. On the one hand, contributions can be moved to another topic of the same forum, on the other hand, entire forum topics or contributions can be moved to another forum. All forum posts underneath are moved and are no longer visible in the original forum. It is possible to move topics and posts to another forum both in the same course and in other courses. The moved thread can be created as a new discussion thread. In the last step of the move, an email can be sent to all users affected by the move, with the information where the forum is now moved to.

!!! warning "Attention"

    Forum posts can also be moved to forums in which the creator of the post has no access.

Besides the course element "Forum" there is also the possibility to display a central forum for the entire course in the [course toolbar](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md). Das bietet sich häufig an, wenn der Kurs nur ein Forum umfasst, das permanent zur Verfügung stehen soll. However, no further settings such as pseudonymization or assignment of moderation rights can be made here.
  
###  Course Element: File Dialog {: #file_dialog}
![File dailog icon](../assets/file_dialog_icon.png)

The course element File Dialog can be understood as a combination of forum and folder. The course element "File dialog" provides you with preset discussion forums; in contrast to an ordinary forum, dialogs here are explicitly based on certain documents. Use such a file dialog to let your course participants discuss e.g. scientific articles or papers.

In the editor in the tab "Files" or in the runtime files can be uploaded in the storage of the file dialog with "Upload file". Afterward they can be looked up and downloaded by the course participants. The related discussion forum is created automatically and opens with a click on "Show". The different columns give an overview who uploaded which file when.

Who besides the course owner can take which actions will be defined in the course editor in the user permissions of the tab "Configuration".

#### Tab Configuration
Here you can set the user rights of the module and define which course roles are allowed to upload files and create discussion topics. In addition, you can define who is allowed to create forum posts in the respective discussion topics. You can choose between coaches and participants. It can also be set here whether coaches are allowed to moderate the file discussion.

![Configuration options for file dialog](assets/file_dialog_config.png){ class="shadow" }

!!! warning "Achtung"

    A discussion can only begin when a corresponding file has been uploaded.

###  Course Element: Participant folder {: #participant_folder}
![Participant folder icon](../assets/participant_folder_icon.png)


The course element "Participant folder" allows you to exchange files between
participants and coaches. With the creation of the course element there are
two folders available. On one side this is the drop box where participants can
upload files for the coaches. On the other side it is the return box where
coaches can upload files for all participants together or individually.
Im Prinzip verbergen sich hinter diesem Kursbaustein zwei (Kursbaustein) Ordner einmal mit Schreibberechtigung und einmal ohne, die jedoch nur für Betreuende und einen einzelnen Teilnehmer sichtbar sind. 

!!! info

    A similar configuration of file delivery + file return by coaches can also be     implemented with the [course element "Task",](../task/index.md) only that the possibilities of the task element are much more comprehensive and complex and here also an evaluation or allocation of points can be made.
The course element "Participant folder" allows you to exchange files between participants and coaches. With the creation of the course element there are two folders available. On one side this is the drop box where participants can upload files for the coaches. On the other side it is the return box where coaches can upload files for all participants together or individually.

#### Folder settings
In the folder settings configurations for the drop box and the return box can be made. By default both folders are enabled and delete and override is enabled for the participants. For the drop box some more configurations can be made.

Delete and override can be unenabled. This means that the participants cannot delete any files. Uploaded files stay in the drop box coercively. Further a time interval can be defined. The upload in the drop box is only possible in this time frame. Out of this time frame files can only be downloaded.

If the participant's folder is activated, the participants can upload files or create them directly in OpenOlat. If the administrator of the OpenOlat instance has activated further document editors, it is also possible to create further file formats such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint files.
In the folder settings configurations for the drop box and the return box can
be made. By default both folders are enabled and delete and override is enabled for the participants. 

Additionally the number of files can be limited. As soon as this number is reached no writing tools are available anymore. This means that uploaded files cannot be moved, copied, zipped or unzipped anymore. But they can be deleted, if this option is enabled. If desired only the drop box or only the return box can be enabled.

In the Template Settings tab, subfolders can also be created for both the Submission and Return folders to create a continuous folder structure. For example, a return folder could include a subfolder for content feedback and one for supplemental files, or a submission folder could reflect some desired structure for the submissions. 
  

!!! warning "Attention"

    As for all upload areas, there is a memory limit for the participant folder. The file upload limits set by the administrator and the entire folder limit are displayed when you try to upload a file.


#### Tab Template Einstellungen

In the Template Settings tab, subfolders can be created for both the submission folder and the return folder, creating a continuous folder structure for all participants. For example, a return folder could include a subfolder for content feedback and one for supplemental files, or a submission folder could reflect some desired structure for the submissions. 

!!! warning 

    The subfolders created here cannot be renamed later. Only a deletion and a new creation is possible. In the course run, when you try to rename these subfolders, copies of the subfolders with new names will be created.


###  Course Element: Participant list {: #participant_list}
![group.png](../assets/participant_list_icon.png)

In the participant list, the members of the course can be made visible to everyone. Unlike the [member management](../learningresources/Members_management.md) course tool, which is only visible for course owners, the course element "Participant list" provides a list of all course members to those OpenOlat users allowed to open the respective course. Members are listed depending on their role within the course as either course administrator, coach or participant. Select the user groups to be displayed to course users.

![Configuration options for paricipant list](assets/participant_list_config.png){ class="shadow" }

By linking the member names to their OpenOlat visiting card as well as the
OpenOlat mail service, this course element facilitates contacting your fellow
course members directly from within the course. In the course editor you can
determine whether the e-mail function should be available for all course
participants or just for course owners and coaches. Use the "Send e-mail"
button in the course view to send mails to multiple user (groups). If
required, external mail addresses can also be added.

The course view also offers, apart from the mail function, the online instant
messaging status of listed course participants. A click on the status icon
opens the chat window.

Finally it can be defined, who is allowed to download the participant list as
Excel or to print it. Again it is differentiated between coach and owner or
all users.

!!! info 

    A similar function is available in the toolbar with the "List of participants" tool. However, no further configurations can be made here.

## Administration and Organisation


###  Course Element: Enrolment {: #enrolment}

![enrolment.png](assets/enrolment.png)

The course element "Enrolment" is used to let course participants enroll in
one or more groups. You can also define the order of the groups in the
selection list.

To do this, define in the "Configuration" tab in which and how many **groups**
course participants can enroll. You can also define the order of the groups in
the selection list. If you have not yet created any groups or need more, you
can do so directly in the "Configuration" tab by clicking on "Select" and
"Create". Existing and newly created groups can be edited in the [member
management](../learningresources/Members_management.md).

Use the field "**Allow multiple enrolments**" in order to allow course
participants to enrol in more than one, and if so how many, groups.

In the field "**Delisting allowed**" you can decide if a registered course
participant should have the possibility to delist from a group. In the group
management you can determine while editing groups if there should be a waiting
list and if moving up automatically from that list should be possible.

!!! info "Info"

    If you have previously created one or more learning areas in the administration and assigned groups here, you can also access these learning areas in the "Configuration" tab of the enrollment course element.

### Course Element: Notifications {: #notification}

![notification.png](assets/infomessage.png)

This course element allows you to embed notifications in your course
structure. These notifications will be visible in your course as well as in
the notifications section of each single user. The message can either be a
short info text or an extensive information which is added as attachment (max.
5 MB). During the creation of the notification it can be defined, if the
message should be sent by email to certain user groups of the course
(subscribers, course owners, coaches, members, groups) additionally.

 **Display:** The maximum number of days determines how long notifications
shall be displayed in your course (in days). The maximum number of messages
determines how many messages shall be displayed simultaneously in your course.

 **Subscribe automatically:** By default this course element will be
automatically subscribed. This option can be deactivated here so that course
participants will be able to subscribe to notifications manually.

Messages from notifications course elements can be viewed using the
subscriptions tool in the personal menu. Course authors (in a course) can
determine the amount of notifications that should be displayed in a course.

By default only course authors and moderators are allowed to create messages.
However, all course participants may read messages. In the tab "Notification
configuration" you can adjust this setting according to your wishes.

The number of characters for the message is limited to 32,000. You will
receive information about the number of characters already used in the lower
right corner of the message editor. If the permitted number of characters is
exceeded, a corresponding message is displayed. Note: The number of actual
characters specified differs from the number of visible characters, as the
actual number of HTML code is used.

!!! tip "Tip"

    An element with similar functions, but without specific configuration, can also be found in the toolbar. This is the "[Participant Info](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md)".

###  Course Element: E-Mail  {: #mail}

![contact.png](assets/contact.png)

By means of the course element "E-Mail" you provide your course participants
with the possibility to send an e-mail to pre-defined recipients.

There are two possibilities to send messages. You can either select the pre-
defined groups of recipients you want to send a message to in the tab
"Recipients" or you directly indicate your e-mail addresses. You can select
whether you wish to address owners, coaches and /or participants of either
course, groups or both.

In order to enter several addresses in the field "E-mail addresses" you have
to separate them by line breaks, i.e. each e-mail address has to be put into
one separate row.

#### Distribution to owners/coaches/participants

By checking this box you
those member groups you would like to send a message. When selecting coaches
or participants, chose in a second step whether you wish to address all
members, or either course or group members. (if no box is checked, no mail is
sent).

In the fields "Subject (form)" and "Message (form)" you can optionally pre-
define default values to be edited later on by your course participants when
sending e-mails.

In the fields "Subject (form)" and "Message (form)", you can
optionally specify default values. 

 * *Subject*: If the subject is predefined, it cannot be changed by the participants. 
If the subject is left empty in the template, the participants have to define their 
own subject (mandatory field).
 * *Message*: The predefined message can be edited by the participants when sending an e-mail. 

In addition, the message / subject can be designed with the use of variables
personal and course-related.

#### Use of variables

The following variables can be used in the subject and text of the e-mail:

variable | description
---|--- 
$firstname |The users first name  
$lastname | The users last name  
$fullName | The users full name  
$username | The users username  
$email | The users email adress  
$courseurl | The internet address of the course  
$coursename | The name of the course as defined in the course info page  
$coursedescription | The description of the course as defined in the course info page  
  
!!! info ""

    The user variables refer to the person who triggers and sends the e-mail via the **"Send" button**.

By means of a suitable short title for the course element "E-mail" you can
provide your course participants with information to whom they can send
messages. For privacy reasons they will not be able to see the recipients'
addresses in your e-mail form.

!!! tip "Tip"

    An element "E-mail" with similar functions, but without specific configuration, can also be found in the [toolbar](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md).

  

###  Course Element: Calendar  {: #cal}

![calendar.png](assets/calendar.png)

By means of the course element "Calendar" you can embed a course calendar in
the course structure. It is also possible to add several instances of the same
calendar to the course.

This course element offers an alternative view on the course calendar to be
found in the course toolbar (see "[Using additional course
features](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md)"). Only course authors and
moderators are allowed to create calendar entries by default. However, all
course participants are able to read entries.

In the tab "Calendar configuration" you can define whether participants and
tutors of a course may also set and edit calendar entries. Also you can decide
which date should be displayed when a course calendar is activated from the
course structure. Course calendars will automatically be added to the
[personal calendars](../personal_menu/Calendar.md) of the course members.

When displaying a certain semester week in your calendar and inserting links
on course elements, that calendar will serve as a kind of overview showing all
events and tasks of that week.

Check whether the course element "Calendar" is really the optimal choice for
you. In many cases, especially with [learning path
courses](../learningresources/Learning_path_course.md), it makes more sense to activate the
calendar in the [toolbar](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md) in the
settings.

!!! tip "Tip"

    If you can't find the "Calendar" course element in the course editor, it was disabled by a system administrator.

###  Course Element: Appointment scheduling {: #appointment_scheduling}

![appointment.png](assets/dateentry.png)

The course element Appointment Scheduling can be used to organize enrollments
for specific appointments as well as to find appointments. In general, you can
configure whether multiple appointments can be selected, whether there is a
limit to the number of participants, whether participants can see who has
registered and whether a BigBlueButton room should be assigned.

In the course editor, the course element is added and it can be determined
whether coaches can also edit occasions and appointments or whether this is
only possible by the course owners. If the choice of appointments should only
be possible within a certain time window, the time specifications in the
course editor must be specified accordingly in the tab "Learning path" or, in
the case of conventional courses, the visibility or access must be configured
appropriately.

However, the actual configuration and setup of the dates is done in the course
run with the editor closed. For this purpose, a new enrollment or appointment
is first created via the button "Create occasion" and the basic configuration
is carried out as well as appointments are entered.

![create_occaision.png](assets/create_occasion.png)

Via the button "**Add appointment**" you can also add further appointments to this
voting later.  Also, already created appointments can be revised again via the
three-point link.

![add_appointment.png](assets/Termin_hinzufuegen.jpg)

#### Appointments: create & edit

!!! info "Menu "Create occasion""

    How to configure an enrollment or scheduling

 **Title:** Enter the name of the appointment here, e.g. "Reconciliation
closing meeting", "Kick-off meeting" etc.. The entry is required (mandatory
field).

 **Description:** Explain the appointment selection in more detail.

 **Type:** Decide if it is a date determination for a common date or an
enrollment for one or more dates from a selection, e.g. lab dates.

 **Configuration:** Decide whether the participants are allowed to select only
one or several appointments and whether the names of the participants are
visible for other participants. In the case of "Enrollment", you can also
define whether the coach must confirm the appointment.

 **Organizer:** Define here who will be displayed as the organizer of the
event.

 **Location:** Enter the location of the event here.

 **Max. Participants:** You can limit the number of members for an appointment
(only for "Enrollment").

**Type of appointment:** You can create appointments based on duration, based
on a start and end date, or recurring by specific days of the week. The
selection makes it easier for you to create additional appointments.

!!! info ""

    If "Duration" is selected, when adding further appointments, the appointments will be preconfigured on the same day and the clock times will be adjusted according to the duration.

    If Start/End is selected, the selected times are retained and you only need to adjust the date for new entries.

 **Appointments:**  The concrete election dates are entered here. Click on the
"+ sign" to add new dates. By clicking on the "- sign", dates are deleted
again.

 **Online meeting:** The options are: No, no online appointment or one
directly selects the desired tool BigBlueButton or Teams, provided that
Virtual Classrooms have been activated by the administrator.

!!! tip "Tip"

    If BigBlueButton or Teams is activated, a BigBlueButton or Teams room can be added and further configured for the selected appointments. In this case, "online" is automatically displayed for the location.

A created "occasion" can later be edited, duplicated or deleted by clicking on
the cogwheel. The number of participants for the event can also be restricted
to certain groups. An export of the participants for an event is also
possible.

![occasion.png](assets/Terminplanung_anlass.jpg)

The specific dates of already created schedules can be viewed in more detail
via the "View appointments" link and edited by the course owner or coach. Here
you can add, delete, rebook participants, adjust the description, change
appointments or confirm appointments.

![find_appointment.png](assets/Terminfindung_punkte.jpg)

Participants can use the "**Select appointments**" link to see and select the
appointments they want. If an appointment has been confirmed, this is also
visible.

###  Course Element: LTI Page {: #lti}

![lti.png](assets/basiclti.png)

By means of the course element "LTI page" it is possible to integrate external
learning applications in your course before having their content displayed in
an OpenOlat window. LTI means "Learning Tool Interoperability" and is an IMS
standard to embed external learning applications such as e.g. a chat, a media
Wiki, a test editor, or a virtual lab. More information about LTI can be found
on the LTI project page: [__
http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/)

Indicate the URL to be referenced in the tab "Page content" along with its key
and password. When selecting this LTI page in the course navigation, the user
must accept the data transfer for privacy protection reasons first, before any
user data, course information or keys will be transferred to the embedded
application, password controlled and in the background. Your learning
application will check access rights and grant access with a valid key. A new
query for data transfer only occurs again later if the configuration of the
device changes with regard to the transmitted data.

When the user selects the LTI page in the navigation, the integrated learning
application appears in the OLAT course.

#### Configure LTI page

The following parameters can be configured:

 **URL:** Please indicate the address of your external learning application in
the format "<https://tools.vcrp.de/lti_quiz/lti_quizwand.php>". Further
information on this example can be found
[here](https://olat.vcrp.de/url/RepositoryEntry/1502282140/CourseNode/94291000213998).  

 **Key:** Please indicate the key provided by the supplier of your external
learning application (in the example above this would be "lti_quiz").

 **Password:** Please indicate the corresponding password to your key provided
by the supplier of your external learning application (in the example above
this would be "weeHoo1w").

 **Skip launch page:**  If this option is activated, the connected application
is displayed directly, without the "Display LTI Learning Content" intermediate
page. The administrator can disable this option.

* * *

 **Transmit firstname/name:** By checking this box a user's first and last
name will be transferred to your external learning application. Otherwise
users will be able to use this application anonymously.

 **Transmit e-mail address:** By checking this box a user's e-mail address
will be transferred to your external learning application.

 **Additional attributes:** You can add additional parameters inside this
input box that should be transferred to a learning application. You can e.g.
tell this learning application to transfer a query from the learning platform
OLAT. (External learning applications have to be able to process such
transferred information; therefore it is necessary to have an agreement with
your provider.) You have the choice between text attributes (identical values
for each user) and additional dynamic user attributes (different for each
user). You can add as many attributes as you wish, but note that the LTI
resource must know which attributes are sent as this is not specified in the
standard.

* * *

 **OpenOlat roles:** Here you can configure which role the user will have
when launching the LTI resource. The three OpenOlat roles Author, Coach and
Participant are supported. For each role the mapping can be defined to a
corresponding role on the LTI resource. The following LTI roles are available:
Learner, Instructor, Administrator, Teaching assistant, Content developer and
Mentor .

* * *

 **Transfer score:** Select this checkbox when the LTI resource is generating
a score value that can be transmitted to OpenOlat using the LTI 1.1 standard.
This is optional. The submitted score will appear on the users start screen of
the LTI course element as well as in the efficiency statement of this course.
Please be aware that according to the LTI standard only values between 0 and 1
are allowed.

!!! info "Info"

  If the option "transfer score" is activated, the LTI page can be added as an assessable course element to the course, which then appears in the assessment tool. In addition to that, the score also appears on the homepage of the LTI course element.

 **Scaling factor:** With the scaling factor the LTI results, which must have
a value between 0 and 1 according to the LTI specification, can be scaled to a
more practical value for the OpenOlat course. For example, if you want an LTI
exam to have a maximum of 10 points in OpenOlat, you must specify a scaling
factor of "10". If you want the transmitted score to be unmodified, use the
factor "1".

 **Score needed to pass:** Here you can configure an optional cut value to
define when the LTI course element is considered as being passed. The cut
value relates to the score value after scaling and not to the raw value
transmitted by LTI. In the example above a cut value of "5" is equivalent to
"50%".

* * *

 **Display:** Select the option "Embedded in course (iFrame)" to embed the
LTI resource within the course layout. The option "Display only module, hide
LMS (iFrame)" completely hides OpenOlat while the LTI module is active. With
the option "Open in new window" the LTI resource is opened in a separate
window. This can be useful in case the resource needs a lot of space or has to
be used in parallel with other course elements.

 **Display height:** Select "automatic" or an explicit size in case the
automatic feature does not work properly.

 **Display width:** Select "automatic" or an explicit size in case the
automatic feature does not work properly.

* * *

 **Show all information transmitted on launch (Debug):** By checking this box
other users will be able to see the information sent. This information
includes parameters such as user identification, course title, course element,
etc.By clicking on "Launch Endpoint with BasicLTI Data" in the course view on
top of your display of the data sent you will get to the homepage of your
learning application.

  

###  Course Element: Topic Assignment {: #topic_assignment}

![circle.png](assets/projectbroker.png)

The course element "Topic assignment" is useful if you want to announce e.g.
topics for term papers in your course before having them supervised. Course
authors determine the detailed configuration of their topic assignment. This
comprises e.g. who has the right to announce and supervise topics, how topics
have to be described, or how many topics can be selected by one course
participant. What makes this course element so special is the fact that not
course authors but topic authors will announce and supervise such topics.

#### Editor view

#####  **How to configure topic assignments**

In the tab "Configuration" you determine first how many topics can be selected
by one participant, if this selection is definite or if it has to be accepted
by the topic author first. Furthermore you can add additional fields to
describe a topic in more detail. This description will then be displayed in
the table containing all topics announced. Here you can also determine if
registrations and submissions shall only be possible within a certain period
of time. In the tab "Sub-elements" you can choose if there should be a drop
box as well as a return box in your topic assignment. Course participants will
then upload their files to that drop box while topic authors will return those
files by means of a return box.

**Configure**

* **Do you want to limit the number of Topics per participant?:** 

  When
selecting this option a field will pop up to indicate the number of Topics a
participant may choose from the course element Topic assignment  
  
* **Topic authors have to accept participants:** 

  When selecting this option
participants can only register for a Topic temporarily. Topic authors will
then have to select their candidates before finally accepting them.  
When deselecting this option all participants already registered for this
  Topic will be accepted automatically. However, topic authors are able to
define the maximum number of participants first.  
  
* **Only one Topic allowed (participants accepted will be signed out automatically from other Topics):** 
 
  When selecting this option all users
accepted as participants will be automatically signed out of all other topics
selected before. This means that participants may be registered for only one
Topic

* **Add additional fields:**

  By means of "Add field" you can create fields according to your needs. You can
create up to five additional fields for further details.

  In the field "Name" you can indicate a favored field name.

  You can offer your topic authors a selection of predefined values displayed in
a pull-down menu. Please indicate the corresponding options in the field
"Value" separated by semicolons or line breaks. When using a free-text field
you can leave the field "Value" blank. Topic authors can then fill in a value
of their own choice.

  When selecting "**Appears in table**" this field will be displayed in the overview
as requested. Apart from that this information will appear in the detailed
topic description.

  By means of "**Delete field**" you can delete additional fields.

![additional_fields.png](assets/Themenvergabe_Zusatz_EN.png)

  

* **Manage dates:**

  You can choose which dates should be at the disposal of topic authors.  
  
* **Registration date:** 
 
  A topic author can determine a registration deadline
for a Topic . After this deadline participants will no longer be able to
select or deselect that Topic . However, a topic author still has the option
to sign participants in or out.  
  
* **Deadline:** 

  After a deadline the drop box will be closed. Participants will
then no longer be able to upload documents to that drop box.  
  
  When selecting "Appears in table" your event will be displayed in the
overview.

##### **Further settings for topic assignment**

* **How to appoint topic authors**

  In the tab "Persons in charge" you add those OpenOlat users who should be able
to announce and supervise topics. These persons do not necessarily have to
hold author rights.

  If you remove a topic author who has already announced a topic he will still
be able to supervise it. However, this person will no longer be able to
announce new topics.

* **Role of topic authors**

  When being authorized by a course author to act as topic author you can
announce as well as supervise topics. Just open the course view and navigate
to your topic assignment. . As person responsible for a topic you can edit
that Topic, administer its participants or add more persons responsible for
that topic. In the box "Supervised groups" you will see those groups you are
in charge of.

* **Select elements**

  Here you can determine if the elements Drop box and Return box should be
activated in the course element Topic assignment . In the Drop box
participants will be able to upload files. Topic authors can store files in a
Return box . If there are no modifications all elements will be enabled. When
deselecting the Drop box its tab will be dimmed and no longer accessible.

* **Confirmation of submission**

  You can optionally enter a text to be presented to the user in a new window
after successfully handing in a file. If you do not enter a text, the
following message (or similar) will appear: This is to confirm that John
Miller (jmiller) has sent the file "test.html" on 21-09-04 at 00:14:42.

By selecting the option _Send text additionally as e-mail_ the user will get
an e-mail with the above mentioned confirmation after successfully handing in
a file.

  

  

####  Course view {: #topic_assignment_runtime}

participants have submitted. In the section "Return box" you can put files
already corrected. There will be one sub-folder for each course participant.

  

***From the user's perspective:***

If the topic status is set to "Free", users can register for a topic, as long
as they have not exceeded the maximum possible topic selection. If the topic
status is set to "Occupied", no further users can register. If you have
already selected a topic, the topic status is either "Provisionally assigned"
if the person responsible for the topic has to accept you as a participant, or
"Assigned" if the registration is automatic. As soon as the topic owner
accepts you as a participant, the topic status is set to "Definitively
assigned".

* [Portfolio task](../learningresources/Assessment.md) (manual assessment)
* [Checklist](../learningresources/Assessment.md) (manual & automatic assessment)
* [Assessment](../learningresources/Assessment.md) (manual assessment)
* [LTI](../learningresources/Other.md) (automatic assessment, transferred from LTI page)
* [SCORM](../learningresources/Knowledge_Transfer.md) (automatic assessment, transferred from SCORM module)
* [Test](../learningresources/Assessment.md#Assessment-_test_kursbaustein) (automatic & manual assessment)

Refer to the chapter ["Creating Tests"](../learningresources/Test.md) for more information on creating and configuring tests.

### Evidence of Achievement & Certificate

An evidence of achievement is a confirmation of an existing efficiency control and shows e.g. taken tests or assessed tasks per course. An evidence of achievement must be activated for each single course, and are accessible once there are a) assessable course elements and b) one of those course elements has been completed and assessed. Users can access their personal evidences of achievements in the personal menu and the course, while coaches and authors can review those of coached users in the [Coaching](Coaching.de.md) tool. Printable certificates can be issued with the course setting ["Evidence of achievements"](../learningresources/Course_Settings.md).

All your evidences of achievement and certificates will be listed in your ["Evidence of achievements"](../learningresources/Course_Settings.md). It always opens in a new window and is printable.
