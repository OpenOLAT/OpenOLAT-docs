# General information on forms

Forms can be used both [integrated in courses](Forms_in_Courses.md) and completely independently of a course, e.g. as a questionnaire or entry form in addition to a face-to-face event.

Typical for forms is that they consist of an information element, one or more questions and provide the user with an action option. For example, something can be checked or a selection can be made or own text can be inserted. Depending on the implementation and further integration into a course, the information is anonymous or personal.

In forms many different [question types](../learningresources/Form_editor_Questionnaire_editor.md) like rubric, single selection, multiple selection, text input and file upload are available. Each form consists of a page with one or more questions or elements. Branching is also possible via [Question rules](Question_rules.md).


!!! warning "Attention"

    The predecessor of the learning resource Form was the learning resource Questionnaire (QTI 1.2).

    The support of the old QTI 1.2 questionnaires was terminated with OpenOlat 15. Old questionnaires in QTI 1.2 format can no longer be used. 
    
    You have to create the questionnaires as new learning resource ["Form"](../forms/Three_Steps_to_your_Form.md). Create a new learning resource "Form" for this purpose.
