With the course element "Forum" you can easily enable asynchronous online discussions for different purposes in your course. For example, course participants could write posts with questions about the content of the course and answer each other's questions, or you could initiate a technical discussion or implement specific forum-based online methods. In the chapter "Learning Activities in Courses" you will get further information on opening topics and replying to questions; see section ["Forum"](../learningresources/Working_with_Forums.md). Generally all course participants have read and write permission in a forum.

You can also use the forum as an alternative to the message module for announcements from course authors, especially if queries from learners are desired.

!!! tip "Hint"

    Advise your course participants on subscribing to the forum to be up-to-date.
   
## Tab Configuration

Here you can set the user rights of the forum and define which course roles are allowed to create forum posts. You can choose between coaches, participants and guests. You can also define whether coaches are allowed to moderate the forum and whether pseudonymized postings are allowed in the forum. In the case of pseudonymized forums, the posters can choose a pseudonym themselves. Once a pseudonym has been created, it will always remain active in the forum, but can be changed or switched off as required. The pseudonym can be protected by a user with a password, so that only this user can use this pseudonym. Without password protection the same pseudonym can be used by several users. Furthermore, it can be set that the use of a pseudonym is activated by default. To do this, select the checkbox "Pseudonym activated in individual forum posts".

![Configuration options for forum](assets/forum_config.png){ class="shadow" }

All course owners and [coaches](../basic_concepts/coach.md) have the following additional **moderation rights**. You can:

  * Editing and deleting all posts in a forum; attaching files.
  * Prioritizing threads (sticky): a certain discussion subject will always appear on top of a list.
  * Closing discussion: it will no longer be possible to reply to a certain discussion subject.
  * Hiding discussion: a certain subject will no longer appear in the forum list.
  * Displaying discussion: hidden subject will be displayed anew.
  * Filter for persons: on the forum's overview page posts of every single course participant can be displayed.
  * Archiving forum: posts (as MS Word) and attached files will be zipped before storing them in your personal folder.

Persons with moderation rights can also move forum topics or individual posts. On the one hand, contributions can be moved to another topic of the same forum, on the other hand, entire forum topics or contributions can be moved to another forum. All forum posts underneath are moved and are no longer visible in the original forum. It is possible to move topics and posts to another forum both in the same course and in other courses. The moved thread can be created as a new discussion thread. In the last step of the move, an email can be sent to all users affected by the move, with the information where the forum is now moved to.

!!! warning "Attention"

    Forum posts can also be moved to forums in which the creator of the post has no access.

Besides the course element "Forum" there is also the possibility to display a central forum for the entire course in the [course toolbar](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md). This is often useful if the course includes only one forum that is to be permanently available. However, no further settings such as pseudonymization or assignment of moderation rights can be made here.

## Working with forums

Forums are the central tools for asynchronous discussion in online courses and also in OLAT groups. Forums can be used for exchange between course participants, for organizational arrangements or for professional discussion with the instructor. Some online methods also specifically use forums e.g. for pro-con discussions, the structured collection of ideas on certain aspects (brainstorming), etc.

In forums, participants can ...

### Open discussion topics

If you want to post a new message in the forum, select "Open discussion topic". Title and post are mandatory information. Be sure to use a descriptive title and modify appropriately for reply posts.

With the help of the forum editor you can create and format your post and also attach files. Depending on the configuration by the course owner, you may also be able to publish your post under a pseudonym.

### Reply to forum posts

If you want to reply to an existing forum post, open the discussion topic by clicking on the topic title. Then select "Reply with quote" if you want the initial post to appear below your reply or if you want to respond directly to individual passages of the post. Or select "Reply without citation" to not list the initial post again.

### Mark forum posts

Individual forum posts can be marked. To do so, click on the small flag in the upper right corner of a post in the detailed view of a topic. In the forum overview you can see how many posts per topic have been marked. This makes it easier to find individual posts again or mark them for a later reply.

### Archive forums

When you archive the forum, forum posts and attached files are packed into a ZIP file and can be saved.

### Subscribe to forums

To be notified when new forum posts are made, set the "Changes" slider to "On" in the discussion topics overview. Then you will receive a notification by e-mail or under Subscriptions in the "Personal Tools" section. It does not matter whether a new contribution has been posted by a registered OLAT user or by a guest.

A notification will only be sent if a new post has been created, but not if an existing post has been changed!

You can also attach files to your post, e.g. if your post is more extensive or you refer to a specific file. As a rule of thumb, postings longer than one DIN A4 page should be attached and only briefly touched upon in the posting itself. You can also edit or delete your post at a later time if no one has replied to your post yet.

It is possible that course participants receive additional moderation rights in a forum from the instructor. You can find out exactly what this entails in the chapter "[Communication and Collaboration](../learningresources/Communication_and_Collaboration.md)".

### Display options for forum threads

There are several display options:

* all (nested)
* all (flat)
* a single one
* marked
* new

Users can view all posts below each other (all), with or without indentation. The starting post appears first and the other posts are displayed according to the discussion structure. For extensive forums with many posts, it is useful to use the "new" button to display only the new posts. Especially interesting for more complex discussions is also the view "one". The entire thread structure is displayed here and can thus be traced very well. It is helpful that individual parts can be shown and hidden. In addition, you can quickly recognize new forum posts by the asterisk in this display.

In your "[Profile](../personal_menu/Configuration.md#profile--profile)", upload an image to have your photo appear next to your forum posts instead of the default profile picture.

### Distinction: file discussion

The file discussion represents a combination of forum and file provision. In this way, forum discussions can be created in courses on specific documents, e.g. on a draft of a seminar paper, an image, a concept or a content document. A forum is automatically created for each uploaded file.

To join a discussion, click the "View" link next to the file name. Now you have the same possibilities to open discussion topics or reply to posts as in the forum.

#### Upload file

By default, course participants cannot upload files. However, this option can be enabled by the course owner in the course editor. If you have this option, select "Upload file" to upload your own file. Who uploaded which file and when is recognizable via the columns First name, Last name or Date.
