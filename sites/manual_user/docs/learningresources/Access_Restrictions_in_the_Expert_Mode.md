# Access Restrictions in the Expert Mode

## Introduction to Expert Rules

!!! warning "Attention"

    The settings in the tabs "Visibility" and "Access" are only available in conventional courses. This means that the expert mode can only be used in conventional courses and not in "[Learning path Courses](Learning_path_course.md)".

In the tabs Visibilty and Access of conventional courses, you can
configure additional preferences for many course elements. For instance, you
can block a course element for learners, grant access only for certain groups
or unlock it depending on the date.

In case of more complicated visibility or access rules you can use the "expert
mode", thus enabling you to configure visibility and access of course elements
as required. You can e.g. limit access to a course element to specific user
names, link several types of restrictions to each other or work with relative
date values. The following example illustrates this:

??? tip "Questionnaire example"

    You want to activate a course questionnaire only in the last last course week, but want to set this option up so that you don't forget it later.

    This means that you activate the course element "Survey" date-dependently so that you no longer have to worry about it during the course. In the _Visibility_ and _Access_ tabs of the "Survey" you can enter the start and end dates in simple mode. You can also make your questionnaire only accessible to a certain group of participants. Select "Group-dependent" under Visibility or Access. For example, you could use two different questionnaires for cross- institutional online courses. The only requirement is that you have divided the course participants into (two) different groups which they can now assign.

Expert rules primarily serve to save you time and work or just simplify it.
Therefore, it is worth the effort to take a closer look at them. Just like any
language, expert rules follow a syntax. OpenOlat will indicate an error should
you make a syntactic mistake. This is very helpful, especially at the
beginning if one does not have any or just little programming skills. Expert
rules verify if a certain attribute is TRUE or FALSE.

As an introduction to the syntax of expert rules, you should at first define a
rule in the simple mode. For example, you may generate a "single page", and
click on "Blocked for learners" in the "Access" tab.

Then click on "Display expert mode" and see your first expert rule:

    (  ( isCourseCoach(0) | isCourseAdministrator(0) ) )

The whole term is enclosed in double brackets. The two outer brackets can be omitted in this case. Just try it out. The vertical line in the center "|" is the Boolean operator OR and connects the course coach with the course administrator. Both of them have exclusive access to the "single page".

Now change the Boolen Operator into "**&**":

    isCourseCoach(0) & isCourseAdministrator(0)

This rule grants access exclusively to those course coaches who are also course administrators. This preference is only possible in the expert mode.

You can try out any number of scenarios and insert further attributes and operators. In this chapter you will find further attributes and examples
illustrating their meaning to help you become more acqainted with expert rules.

## Configuration of Expert Rules

Expert rules certify if there is an attribute with a specific value.

Attribute| Description| Example Expert rule  
---|---|---  
isGuest| accessible only for guests| isGuest(0)  
isCourseCoach| available only for coach| isCourseCoach(0)  
isUser| available only for one specific user| isUser("pmuster")  
  
### Working with the constants "TRUE" and "FALSE"

By using the constants "true" and "false", the existence ("true" = "1") or
non-existence ("false" = "0") of an attribute can be verified. In this case,
we refer to a so-called Boolean Variable (named after George Boole, the father
of the Boolean Algebra). These variables can only take a limited number of values or states. In our specific case, the variable can only take the two values ("true" = "1" = existing or "false" ="0" = non-exisiting).

 Example: Enabling areas for guests

To give a practical example in our OLAT context, we will use a simple expert
rule for managing the access to a course element / area in a course:

 **Case 1**: Only guest users should get access to the course. Only guest users should have access to a module,
for example to separate areas for guests and OLAT users. The respective user thus gains access if the attribute "isGuest" is true. There are three
alternatives for this expert rule:

 **isGuest(0)** or **isGuest(0)=1** or **isGuest(0)=true**

 **Case 2**: In this case we want guest users not to have access. The
respective user therefore only gets access if the attribute "isGuest" is
false. There are two alternatives for this expert rule:

 **isGuest(0)=0** or **isGuest(0)=false**

An extensive list of all relevant components needed for applying expert rules
can be found in the following box.

User attributes (UserProperty)

Various expert rules require the use of user attributes in order to filter
eligible users for access content. Those rules enable authors to limit access
rights depending on name, gender, address, field of studies and so on. OpenOlat
provides standardized terms for these attributes. The following expert rules require the use of user attributes:

  * getUserProperty _(" _[userPropertyname ]_")_
  * hasUserProperty("[ _userPropertyname]", " [string]")_
  * userPropertyStartswith(" [ _userPropertyname ]", "[substring]")_
  * userPropertyEndswith(" [ _userPropertyname ]", "[substring]")_
  * isInUserProperty(" [ _userPropertyname ]", "[substring]")_
  * isNotInUserProperty("[ _userPropertyname ]", "[substring]")_
  * hasNotUserProperty("[ _userPropertyname ]", "[string]")_

For the following expert rules, a delimiter can be specified in the third
parameter if it is a **multi-value field** :

  * hasUserProperty("[ _userPropertyname]", "[string]", " , ")_
  * hasNotUserProperty("[ _userPropertyname]", "[string]", " , ")_

The following user attributes are available in OpenOlat. Please note that
access restrictions using user attributes can only be successful if those user
attributes are used and generally filled in throughout your system. Simply
check your user profile in the the personal menu in Configuration/Profile for
available user attributes. For questions, please contact your system
administrator.

Examples on how to apply "getUserProperty":

  * Only course participants of a specific field of study should be granted access:
    
        getUserProperty("studySubject") = "Mechanical Engineering"

Now anybody who needs access must first complete the field "field of study" in
their profile and state it as Mechanical Engineering.

  * The other way round, should you intend to grant access only to those who have not stated their field of study in their profile, you can express the corresponding rule as follows:
    
        getUserProperty("studySubject") = ""

  * Should you want to grant access only course participants who have completed the field of study in their profile (no matter what the study subjects are), the rule can be defined as follows:
    
        getUserProperty("studySubject") = "" = false

or

        getUserProperty("studySubject") = "" = 0

There are various options to interrelate single rules to each other. The two
most important operators to combine attributes are:

  * AND conjunction: &
  * OR conjunction: |

Please note that an OR conjunction precedes an AND conjunction. In order to
handle an AND conjunction, first you have to use brackets.

Example: The expert rule (inGroup("Participants IntensiveCourse") |
isCourseCoach(0)) means that either participants of an intensive course or all
coaches of groups will have access to a course element.

Some examples are listed below in order to show you how to use the expert
syntax.

## Examples expert mode

**Examples of expert rules in the tabs ¬´Visibility¬ª, ¬´Access¬ª and ¬´Score¬ª (structural elements)**

inLearningGroup("Tutor")**  
This course element is visible for all participants between 22-3-2018 and
23-8-2018. For members of the learning group _¬´Tutor¬ª_ it is always visible.  

 **(now >= date("03.09.2018 00:00")) & (now <= date("13.10.2018 00:00")) &
inRightGroup("Assessors")| isUser("Author")**  
This course element is visible for all participants of the right group
_¬´Assessors¬ª_ between 3-9-2018 and 13-10-2018. For the person with the user

 **(getUserProperty("orgUnit") = "Sales")**  
Checks if a person is part of the organizational unit 'Sales.' This can be
useful if e.g. data are automatedly transferred from LDAP.  

**(getPassed("69742969114730") | getPassed("69742969115733") |
getPassed("69742969118009")) * 10**  
This rule is set in the tab _¬´Score¬ª_ -> _¬´Processing score¬ª_ of the course
element _Structure_ . The course element _Structure_ shows 10 points if one of
the tests (course element IDs "69742969114730", "69742969115733" or
"69742969118009") was passed. Otherwise 0 points.

getScore("69742969118009")) >= 140 | getPassed("69978845384688")**  
This rule is set in the tab _¬´Score¬ª_ -> _¬´Passed if¬ª_ of the course element
_Structure_ . The course element _Structure_ shows _¬´Passed¬ª_ , if a minimum
of 140 points in all tests is achieved or if _¬´Passed¬ª_ is entered manually.
(Element _Assessment_ with ID "69978845384688").  

**getAttempts("70323786958847") > 0 **  
Generates TRUE, as soon as the relevant course participant has completed the
test with specified ID for the first time, regardless of the score.  

**getAttempts("70323524635734") <= 3 **  
Generates FALSE, as soon as the relevant course participant has put more than
3 files into the storage folder of the course element ~~_Task (deprecated)_~~
.  

**getLastAttemptDate("70323524635734") + 24h < now **

**(getInitialCourseLaunchDate(0) >= never) | (getInitialCourseLaunchDate(0) +
2h > now)**  
Generates TRUE if a course participant has not yet taken any courses or during

that each course participant can only see courses for a certain period of
time.  

**(getRecentCourseLaunchDate(0) + 10min < now) **  
Generates TRUE if a user is active for more than 10 min within a course.  

**(getCourseBeginDate(0) <= today) & (getCourseEndDate(0) >= today)**  
Returns the value TRUE if today's date lies in between the start and end date

Returns the value TRUE if the course is within an assessment.  

 **hasUserProperty("email","john.doe@[openolat.org](http://openolat.org/)")  
** Generates TRUE, if the course participant is registered in OpenOlat with
the listed e-mail address.  

 **hasUserProperty("typeOfUser","staff", " , ")**  
Generates TRUE, if the student also has the value "staff" in the "Type of
user" field, e.g. "staff, student".  

 **userPropertyEndswith("email","@openolat.org")**  
Generates TRUE, if the e-mail address of the course participant ends with
_@openolat.org_.  

 **isInUserProperty("email","doe@openo")**  
Generates TRUE, if the term _doe@openo_ is a part of the e-mail address of the
course participant.  

 **isNotInUserProperty("email","doe@openo")**  
Generates FALSE, if the term _doe@openo_ is a part of the e-mail address of the
course participant.

    Please note that the IDs of the course elements mentioned above are only examples. To create your course, you have to make reference to the relevant numbers available on the first tab _¬´Title and description¬ª_ of the favored course element.

## Use of AAI Attributes

If you are enrolled at swiss academia or any other institution with access to
an AAI infrastructure, by means of AAI attributes you can set access rules
within a course to make sure that only course participants with specific user
attributes (e.g. members of a certain organization) will have access to your
course material. AAI means "Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure"
and allows university members to use systems of other participating
institutions with only one username and password. For further information on
AAI please go to e.g. [Switch](http://www.switch.ch/aai/ "Switch") or to
[Deutsches Forschungsnetz](https://www.aai.dfn.de/en/ "Deutsches Forschungsnetz") .

Available attributes and possible values are described in the AAI Attribute
Specification on the
[Switch](https://www.switch.ch/aai/docs/AAI_Attr_Specs.pdf "Switch") and the
[DFN-AAI](https://www.aai.dfn.de/der-dienst/attribute/ "DFN-AAI") site (in
German). The two most common attributes at swiss universities can be found in
the following table along with examples of their corresponding expert rules:

Attribute| Description| Example Expert rule and Explication  
---|---|---  
swissEduPerson-HomeOrganization| University or home organization| hasAttribute ("swissEduPersonHomeOrganization", "[uzh.ch](http://uzh.ch)"): only members of the Zurich University will get access.  
swissEduStudyBranch3| Field of study, 3rd classification| hasAttribute ("swissEduPersonStudyBranch3","6400"): only veterinary medicine students will have access.  
  
### Utilization

You can retrieve AAI attributes by using the syntax  
**_hasAttribute("_ [AttrName] _","_ [string] _")_** or  
**_isInAttribute("_ [AttrName] _","_ [substring] _")_**.

The following applies:

* **[AttrName]** is the attribute name you can find in the following table and also in the Specification of AAI attributes (pdf file) (column _LDAP names_ ) on page 5.
* **[string]** is the value of the AAI attribute with the name [AttrName].
* **[substring]** is any part of [string].
  
#### AAI example

_Values for John Doe_
