# Form elements {: #form_elements} 

You can insert the following content elements into a form layout using the "Add content" link:

![form_content_types_v1_de.png](assets/form_content_types_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

In general, all elements from the "Question types" section can be configured as mandatory or voluntary. Mandatory means that participants must complete this element in order to be able to save the form. With "voluntary", the form can also be saved if the element has not been completed. 

Furthermore, many elements can be provided with a special *hint box* (see below) and the size of the space between individual elements can also be defined in the "Layout" tab.

## Title {: #form_element_title}

## Rubric {: #form_element_rubric}

A rubric element consists of a grid with rows and columns. The assessment categories or statements are listed in the rows, while the column headings reflect the assessment scales. In this way, several different statements can refer to one rating scale.
Depending on the specific configuration, very different rubric variants can be created which can also be used in courses as an assessment element for teachers or as [Peer-Reviews](../learningresources/Course_Element_Task.md) in the task module.

## Single choice {: #form_element_sc}

In a single choice, course participants must select exactly 1 option from a list.

* You can add further selection options to the list using the "Add entry" button.
* The entries can be moved up or down using the arrow buttons.
* The individual answer options can be displayed next to each other, one below the other or as a selection menu using the "Selection list" option.

!!! Tip "Note"

    If the selection is to be linked to a question, you must use a separate text element for this. The same applies to multiple selections.

The individual selection can also be used as the basis (condition) for the [Question rules](Form_Question_Rules.md). This allows certain containers and their contents to be displayed depending on the answer selected by the user.

Assign a meaningful name (title) to the element so that you can keep track of the question rules.

Assign a meaningful name (title) to the element so that you can keep track of the question rules.

The title you enter here will appear in the head of the hint box.

**With icon**<br>
If you select this option, an icon is displayed in the top left-hand corner of the message box, e.g. an "i" if "Information" is selected as the type.
