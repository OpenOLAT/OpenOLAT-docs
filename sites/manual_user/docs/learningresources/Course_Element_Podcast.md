Specialty / Note | 

The course element "Podcast" can either be used to publish self-created audio and video files chronologically and make them available in a course element or to simply integrate external podcast episodes into OpenOlat.

A podcast provides information in the form of audio or video files. On the one hand, you can listen to or view these so-called episodes directly in OpenOlat; on the other hand, you can subscribe to podcasts, download the episodes to local portals such as iTunes and copy them to your mobile device.

It is also possible to configure the course element so that course participants can create episodes of the podcast together.

## Create or edit episode

Personen die berechtigt sind neue Episoden zu erstellen (vergl. [Podcast konfigurieren](../learningresources/Podcast_Further_Configurations.md)) sehen den Button "Episode hinzufügen" und können so ihren Audio- oder Videobeitrag in den Podcast hochladen. 

An episode always contains exactly one audio or video file. Select it on your computer so that it can be uploaded afterwards. This may take some time depending on the size of the file. Note that only Flash-compatible formats are allowed (i.e. FLV, MP3, MP4, M4V, M4A and AAC).

Das genaue Vorgehen wird in Schritt 4 der Seite [Wie erstelle ich einen Podcast?](../../../manual_how-to/docs/podcast/podcast.de.md) beschrieben. 

## Comment on episodes
