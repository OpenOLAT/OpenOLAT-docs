# Course Element "Podcast" {: #podcast}

![icon podcast](assets/podcast.png)

The course element "Podcast" can either be used to easily provide others with
your own audio and video files or with external podcast episodes in OpenOlat.
Course participants can see episodes directly within OpenOlat; or they can
subscribe to podcasts, upload those by means of online services such as iTunes
before copying them to a mobile device.

How to [create](../resource_podcast/Four_Steps_to_Your_Podcast.md) and
[configure](../resource_podcast/Podcast_-_Further_Configurations.md) a podcast is explained in
separate chapters.
