The course element "Podcast" can either be used to easily provide others with your own audio and video files or with external podcast episodes in OpenOlat Course participants can see episodes directly within OpenOlat; or they can subscribe to podcasts, upload those by means of online services such as iTunes before copying them to a mobile device.

A podcast provides information in the form of audio or video files. On the one hand, you can listen to or view these so-called episodes directly in OpenOlat; on the other hand, you can subscribe to podcasts, download the episodes to local portals such as iTunes and copy them to your mobile device.

To create new episodes, you must be authorized by the instructor. Then click Add Episode and create the new podcast.

## Create or edit episode

Enter a title that describes the episode as accurately as possible. This field is mandatory. The description is optional. If the media file needs additional remarks, they can be specified here. 

An episode always contains exactly one audio or video file. Select it on your computer so that it can be uploaded afterwards. This may take some time depending on the size of the file. Note that only Flash-compatible formats are allowed (i.e. FLV, MP3, MP4, M4V, M4A and AAC).

Clicking "Publish" adds the episode to the podcast and makes it available to others.

However, every OpenOlat user is allowed to comment on episodes and rate them with 1-5 stars. To post a comment or read existing comments, click on the "Comments" link. 

Subscribe to the podcast's RSS feed to never miss new episodes.
