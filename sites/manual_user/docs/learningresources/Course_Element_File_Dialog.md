The course element File Dialog can be understood as a combination of forum and folder. The course element "File dialog" provides you with preset discussion forums; in contrast to an ordinary forum, dialogs here are explicitly based on certain documents. Use such a file dialog to let your course participants discuss e.g. scientific articles or papers.

In the editor in the tab "Files" or in the runtime files can be uploaded in the storage of the file dialog with "Upload file". Afterward they can be looked up and downloaded by the course participants. The related discussion forum is created automatically and opens with a click on "Show". The different columns give an overview who uploaded which file when.

Who besides the course owner can take which actions will be defined in the course editor in the user permissions of the tab "Configuration".

## Tab Configuration
Here you can set the user rights of the module and define which course roles are allowed to upload files and create discussion topics. In addition, you can define who is allowed to create forum posts in the respective discussion topics. You can choose between coaches and participants. It can also be set here whether coaches are allowed to moderate the file discussion.
