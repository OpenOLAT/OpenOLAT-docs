Forms can be used in many different ways in OpenOlat. They can be used as normal forms with free text fields, in the form of questionnaires, as evaluation rubrics or for self-assessment. Their use depends on the objectives and application scenarios.

This chapter explains how to create and configure forms for the purposes mentioned.
