# Forms - Overview

Forms can be used in many different ways in OpenOlat: 

* As normal forms (to be ticked or with free text fields), 
* in the form of online surveys, 
* as assessment rubrics 
* or for self-assessment.

The use depends on the objectives and application scenarios.

Here you will find information on how to create and configure forms for the purposes mentioned.

!!! info "Note"

    There is a form **learning resource** and a form **course element**. Please distinguish between the two. The concept behind this is explained in the manual [How do I create a form learning resource?](../../manual_how-to/create_a_form/create_a_form.md).
