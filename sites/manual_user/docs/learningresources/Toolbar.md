# Toolbar: Overview {: #toolbar}

The toolbar is located at the top of the page, directly below the main navigation bar, and displays various icons for tools.

**Example Participant**:

![toolbar_example_course_participant_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_example_course_participant_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

**Example Course Owner/Coach**:

![toolbar_example_course_owner_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_example_course_owner_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

The course owner decides whether the toolbar is visible to course participants. It is always visible to coaches and owners.<br>
[More >](#show_icons)

If the toolbar is displayed for participants, course owners can decide which icons are displayed there and enable or disable them for specific courses as needed.
[More >](#show_icons)

The tools then appear either in the toolbar or under "My Course".

### Administration  {: #admin}

![toolbar_admin_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_admin_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

---

### Status {: #status}

![toolbar_status_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_status_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

[More >](../learningresources/Access_configuration.md)

---

### Course info {: #info_page}

![toolbar_course_info_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_course_info_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

General information about the course, such as a description of the event or the dates and location, can be found under Course Information.
This information is visible even before learners can access a course.<br>
[More >](../learningresources/Info_page.md)

### Learning path {: #learning_path}

![toolbar_learning_path_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_learning_path_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

**Appeal by participants**<br>
The learning path icon in the toolbar gives learners an overview of their progress in all course modules. Depending on the columns selected, additional information such as the type of implementation and dates can also be displayed. This makes it easy for learners to keep track of their activities in the course.

![Mein Lernpfad](assets/Mein_Lernpfad.png)

**Appeal by course owners and coaches**<br>
Course owners and coach can use the "Learning Path" link to get an overview of all participants and then select an individual to view their learning progress.

### Calendar {: #calendar}

![toolbar_calendar_v1_de.png](assets/toolbar_calendar_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox"}

One calendar can be activated per course. There are two options for integration. The calendar can either be displayed as a [calendar course element](../learningresources/Course_Element_Calendar.md) or in a central position at the top of the course toolbar.

In addition to the course calendar, OpenOlat offers other calendars:

- [Personal calendar >](../personal_menu/Calendar.md)
- [Group calendar >](../groups/Using_Group_Tools.md)

New events are easily created by clicking on the desired date. You can then set the title, description, start and end times, location (if applicable), possible repetitions, and visibility. The event will then appear in the calendar or in all instances of the course calendar and can be edited by clicking on the date and selecting the "Edit" option.

The "Edit" option also gives you access to additional calendar tabs and allows you to set links to course elements used in the course or external websites. If you want to delete all dates in a course calendar, simply click on the gear icon in the calendar area and select "Reset calendar."

Course calendars are also automatically transferred to the personal calendars of course members. This means that all dates can also be accessed directly via the personal OpenOlat calendar. The same applies to group calendars. For group calendars, the group administration can set the write and read permissions that members receive.

By default, only course owners have write access to the calendar. Course participants only have read access, meaning they cannot create new events or edit existing ones. However, if you add the calendar as a course element, you can configure the permissions in the course editor under the "Access" tab.

However, the configuration options are not as extensive as those for the "Folder" course element.
