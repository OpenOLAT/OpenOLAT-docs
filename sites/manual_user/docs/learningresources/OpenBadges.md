## What is a badge? {: #what_is_a_badge}

Open Badges is a system of digital certificates or **learning badges** that they can use to award individual progress.<br>
A badge is online proof that a goal has been achieved. It consists of
* an image (svg oder png), 
* Meta information (description of the goal achieved, period of validity of the badge, issuer of the badge, date of issue, etc.)
* a link

The difference between a paper certificate and an online badge is that the badge can be shared online via links. For example, it can be included in a CV or portfolio.
For example, a badge recipient can also include the badges on their LinkedIn profile.

In contrast to a formal certificate, the idea of the badge is more playful (gamification, to loosen up and motivate, the learners gain something).

## Where can badges be purchased? {: #badge_categories}

Basically 3 categories of badges can be acquired:

* **Badges for a course**<br> (for passing the course or fulfilling the conditions set out there)
* **Badges for a specific course element**<br> (like course badges, with a condition for a specific course element)
* and **global Badges**<br> (cross-course, can only be created by administrators)

### Assign global badges manually

Global badges can be assigned manually by administrators under<br>
**Administration > e-Assessment > OpenBadges > "Global Badges" tab > Button â€œAssign badge manually"**.<br>

### Global badges assigned automatically

Administrators can set up the rules for automatic assignment under<br>
**Administration > e-Assessment > OpenBadges > "Global Badges" tab**.<br>
If the badge tool for creating a global badge is called up there, the rules can be specified in the wizard.
