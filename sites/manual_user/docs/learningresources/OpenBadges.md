## What is a badge? {: #what_is_a_badge}

Open Badges is a system of digital certificates or **learning badges** that they can use to award individual progress.<br>
A badge is online proof that a goal has been achieved. It consists of

* an image (svg oder png), 
* Meta information (description of the goal achieved, period of validity of the badge, issuer of the badge, date of issue, etc.)
* a link

The difference between a paper certificate and an online badge is that the badge can be shared online via links. For example, it can be included in a CV or portfolio.
For example, a badge recipient can also include the badges on their LinkedIn profile.

In contrast to a formal certificate, the idea of the badge is more playful (gamification, to loosen up and motivate, the learners gain something).

## Where can badges be purchased? {: #badge_categories}

Basically 3 categories of badges can be acquired:

* **Badges for a course**<br> (for passing the course or fulfilling the conditions set out there)
* **Badges for a specific course element**<br> (like course badges, with a condition for a specific course element)
* and **global badges**<br> (cross-course, can only be created by administrators) 

Global badges are independent of courses. Other badges relate to a specific course element or course. The same badge cannot be awarded in different places, e.g. for different course elements.

### Assign global badges manually

Global badges can be assigned manually by administrators under<br>

### Global badges assigned automatically

### Where can badges be edited?

!!! note "Note"

    Badges can only be edited as long as no one has yet acquired this badge.

**In the course administration:**<br>
Administration > Badges > Click on the 3 dots at the end of a row > Option "Edit"

If coaches have also been granted the right to assign badges manually (Administration > Settings > Assessment tab > Badges section), then an overview is also available for coaches in the "Administration" menu under "Badges". However, coaches cannot create new badges, only assign them manually.

**In the course menu (as course owner):**<br>
Select a course element to which a badge can be added. [(Find the list of course elements with badges here)](#where-can-badges-for-course-elements-be-created--create_for_course_elements). Then click on the "Badges" tab. If a badge assignment has been set up for this course element, you can also click on the 3 dots at the end of a row and you will find the "Edit" option there.<br>

## View of awarded course badges {: #assigned_badges}

The awarding of **course badges** is enabled by course owners in each course under<br>
**Settings > Assessment tab > Badges section** <br>
The right to manual assignment can also be given to coaches here.

If badges have been activated, the **Badges** option will be available in **Course administration** after the next login. The rules for awarding badges for the course can be set up here.

If badges have been acquired by participants, they can be seen in the **performance overview** of the participant concerned.



#### View awarded badges in LinkedIn and other websites {: #assigned_badges_LinkedIn}

In principle, the display of OpenOlat badges on other websites can be done manually by exporting and importing.

LinkedIn allows you to display certificates in your personal profile. The certificate or badge is checked with a host-based verification.
A similar process is used to verify the certificate or badge.
