Documents coach

This menu gives coaches the possibility to store files. All coaches and course owners can access this area.

In order for this menu to appear, the option "Documents coach folder" must first be activated in the course under "Administration" -> "Settings" in the "Options" tab.

An existing folder of the course's storage folder can be selected as the storage location in the Options tab or a new folder can be generated specifically for the coaches in the storage folder. If the "Automatically generated folder" option is selected, coaches, unlike course owners, do not have access to other files or folders located in the courses storage folder. On the other hand, course owners or people with access to the course editor have full access to the storage folder and can also see the coaches' files in the automatically generated "coachdocuments" folder. This means that course owners always have access to the files in the coach folder and can also use them to link to certain course elements, e.g. an individual page. Conversely, coaches do not have the option of integrating files into the course structure with this coach folder.
