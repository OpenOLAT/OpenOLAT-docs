# Blog: Overview {: #blog_learning_resource_overview}

## What are blogs?

The term "Blog" comprises "World Wide Web" and "Log". Blogs usually serve as online journals for personal as well as professional information. With the help of blogs you can provide your course participants with texts, pictures or videos in a swift and easy way. Entries will be displayed sorted by time; the latest news will always be on top. Course participants can subscribe to blogs via RSS Feed. They can also comment on entries and assess them.

    A blog is generally used like a public diary. Its advantage is its quick, standardized publication.



## Create a blog

Creating blogs here means creating the blog learning resources and integrating the learning resources into a course element. (Not the addition, editing, commenting and rating of contributions by course participants in the course run. This is called [Blogging](Blog_Blogging.md).)
