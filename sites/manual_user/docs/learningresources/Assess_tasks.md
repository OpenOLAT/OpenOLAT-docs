# Assess tasks

The assessment of handed in tasks can be done by coaches and course owners
either in the assessment tool or directly in the run time view.

You can find out in detail how tasks and group tasks are evaluated in the
assessment tool in the chapter [Assessment
tool](../learningresources/Assessment_tool_overview.md) â†’
[Assessing tasks and group
tasks](../learningresources/Assessing_tasks_and_group_tasks.md).
The following is a brief description of how the assessment is performed in the
run time view:

## Coach view

In the run time view you get to the assessment area by clicking on the
corresponding task. If the coach or course owner is participant at the same
time in the course the tabs "Favorites" and "All participants" appear. If the
assignment is stored directly in the task, the tab "Edit tasks and sample
solutions" also appears. If a coach may also create tasks, the tab "Edit tasks
and sample solutions" is also visible for him.

The table displays the current workflow step. The ![Action needed](assets/action_needed.png){ class=size16 } indicates whether the coach needs to take action. The steps Review and Correction require coach input in order for the user to be able to finalize
the task. Whether the step Solution (without icon) includes the assessment
step, depends on the configuration of the task. The Grading step is only
displayed if no sample solution is available, but remains, even with the
assessment already carried out. Chose the column according to your needs.

![All participants](assets/task_correction.png){ class="shadow" }

Clicking on an individual person in the participant list takes you to the
assessment workflow for that person and allows you to upload feedback and
assign points, depending on the configuration of the task.

All files uploaded by the participant can be downloaded in the tab
"Submissions" as well as in the assessment tool with one click on the button
"Download all submitted files". The single uploads are saved sorted after
learners (last name, name, username) with the corresponding sub folders as
zip file.

If no file is uploaded until the submission deadline it is marked in the
overview as "No submission".

  
!!! tip
    If you are simultaneously registered in the course as a course owner and
    a participant, you can switch between the respective roles to see how the task
    looks from the learner's point of view.

How course participants will see the course element "Task" will be explained
in the chapter "Learning Activities in Courses," section ["Task and Group
Task"](../learningresources/Course_Elements.md).

### Changing return and feedback documents

To change the feedback documents of individual participants under "Return and
feedback" for a task that has already been completed, you can proceed as
follows:

!!! warning
    Feedback documents can only be changed as long as the submission deadline has
    not yet passed. If necessary, this deadline has to be extended!

    In order to prevent participants from accessing the task again in this case,
    the course element can be " blocked for learners" in the course editor -->
    Visibility tab, for example. Attention: this option is not available in the
    learning path course!

- Select the participant in the course element.
- In the "Submission" step, select "Reopen submission".
- A message will appear that all submitted documents will be deleted. This only applies to the coach view! All uploaded documents of the participant remain unchanged!
- After confirming the message, you can click on a button " Collect all submitted documents". The participant documents are now available again in the coach view.
- The feedback and return documents are now also editable again, can be exchanged, added or deleted.

!!! warning
    Don't forget: Change the submission deadline back to the original value, and
    participants will no longer be able to submit anything. Also, the restriction
    of visibility for learners on the course element can now be removed again so
    that the task is available again for all participants in the course
    navigation.
