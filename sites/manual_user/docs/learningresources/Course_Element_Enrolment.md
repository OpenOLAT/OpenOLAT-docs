# Course Element "Enrolment" {: #enrolment}

![enrolment.png](assets/enrolment.png)

The course element "Enrolment" is used to let course participants enroll in
one or more groups. You can also define the order of the groups in the
selection list.

To do this, define in the "Configuration" tab in which and how many **groups**
course participants can enroll. You can also define the order of the groups in
the selection list. If you have not yet created any groups or need more, you
can do so directly in the "Configuration" tab by clicking on "Select" and
"Create". Existing and newly created groups can be edited in the [member
management](../course_operation/Members_management.md).

Use the field "**Allow multiple enrolments**" in order to allow course
participants to enrol in more than one, and if so how many, groups.

In the field "**Delisting allowed**" you can decide if a registered course
participant should have the possibility to delist from a group. In the group
management you can determine while editing groups if there should be a waiting
list and if moving up automatically from that list should be possible.

    If you have previously created one or more learning areas in the administration and assigned groups here, you can also access these learning areas in the "Configuration" tab of the enrollment course element.
