# Events and absences {: #course_admin_events_and_absences}

Absence management offers the option of keeping attendance lists online and documenting absences. Attendance is monitored for each course. To this end, appointments can be created for the course, which can then be divided into several units. For example, a morning (=appointment) can be divided into several time blocks (=units).
The units allow participants to miss individual units on a date without being marked as absent for the entire date. These units are also created in the course by course owners (or synchronized with OpenOlat from an external administration system).

If the course owner has enabled (configured) appointment and absence management for the course in **Administration > Settings > Implementation**, the menu item "Events and absences" is displayed to course owners in the course administration (for recording the duration data).

Here you can create and edit course dates and record absences.

!!! info "Note"

    Course **coaches** will not find this item in the course administration menu. They can access the screen for recording absences via the icon in the toolbar.

    Course owners can also use the icon in the toolbar to record data. However, in the menu under Administration, you will also find the option reserved for them to create appointments.

![events_and_absences_tab_events_create2_v1_de.png](assets/events_and_absences_tab_events_create2_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

**Title**: Give it a meaningful name.

**Characteristic**: The optional specification of a label serves to distinguish between events with the same title.

**Date**: A date must be specified.

**Time**: The time field is also mandatory. This is because calendar entries, for example, can only be displayed correctly if a time is specified.

**Unit**: This specifies how many (time) units this event comprises.<br>
An event can comprise 1â€“12 units.<br>
Example: An event lasts 2 hours, divided into 4 thematic units (4 x 0.5 hours).

**Place**: This is where you specify where this appointment will take place. This could be a location or the exact room name, for example.

**Online Meeting**: If the appointment is to take place online, the meeting can be organized directly from here.

**Lecturers**: A course coach must be selected for each appointment. Only the selected course coach can carry out attendance checks. (Only a person who also has the role of "Coach" can be added as a lecturer.) If a course owner also wishes to take on this role, they must additionally register as a course coach for the course.

**Description**: Here you can optionally add a description for the appointment.

**Preparation/Follow-up**: If you would like to give participants a pre- or post-assignment for the respective event, you can add it here. It will be displayed in the calendar if the dates are synchronized with the course calendar (Course Administration > Settings > Implementation tab).

**Presence**: If the switch is set to "Off," absence recording is deactivated.
