## Learning path course

## What are learning path courses?

Since OpenOlat version 15, there are two variants of OpenOlat courses:
Traditional courses and Learning Path courses.

The learning path course type helps learners keep track of their course
activities. The visualization of the learning path shows at a glance what they
have already completed, where the
[learners](Learning_path_course_-_Participant_view.md) are currently in the
course and which course elements they may or must still work on.

Authors and coaches also benefit from the new course type. For coaches, the
learning path report provides improved participant tracking. This makes it
possible to react to the individual learning progress of participants and
offer targeted support.

Learning path courses are primarily intended for linear course structuring,
but can also be structured entirely or in parts hypertextually. Learning path
courses are particularly suitable for the development of self-learning courses
and online tutorials. Learning paths can be used to give learners a specific
structure and sequence to follow.

If nothing else is mentioned in the online help, the term "course" refers to
conventional courses. If it is about learning path courses, this will be
mentioned explicitly.

!!! warning "Warning"

    Please note: Learning path courses cannot be unlocked for guests. If this is
    an important aspect for your implementation, please use a conventional course.
