In the participant list, the members of the course can be made visible to everyone. Unlike the [member management](../learningresources/Members_management.md) course tool, which is only visible for course owners, the course element "Participant list" provides a list of all course members to those OpenOlat users allowed to open the respective course. Members are listed depending on their role within the course as either course administrator, coach or participant. Select the user groups to be displayed to course users.

By linking the member names to their OpenOlat visiting card as well as the
OpenOlat mail service, this course element facilitates contacting your fellow
course members directly from within the course. In the course editor you can
determine whether the e-mail function should be available for all course
participants or just for course owners and coaches. Use the "Send e-mail"
button in the course view to send mails to multiple user (groups). If
required, external mail addresses can also be added.

The course view also offers, apart from the mail function, the online instant
messaging status of listed course participants. A click on the status icon
opens the chat window.

Finally it can be defined, who is allowed to download the participant list as
Excel or to print it. Again it is differentiated between coach and owner or
all users.

    A similar function is available in the toolbar with the "List of participants" tool. However, no further configurations can be made here.
