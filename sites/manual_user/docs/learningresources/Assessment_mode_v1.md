# Assessment mode

!!! note "Note"

    Before version 18.2, the configuration of the exam mode was a separate menu option in the course administration. From version 18.2, the configuration of the check mode can be found under<br> **Administration > Assessment Management > Tab "Assessment mode"** <br>
    You will therefore find the description in the manual [here](Assessment_mode.md).
