Assessable | no
Specialty / Note | 



Using the course element "Form" you can add the learning resource form to a
course. The form works similar to the course element "Survey" and can also be
filled out only once. However, with the form it is visible which participant
has filled in what in the form. Thus, in contrast to the survey (at least in
the standard setting), filling in the form is not anonymous. 

For the
completion of the course element, a last deadline can be defined in the tab
"Form". A [course reminder](../learningresources/Course_Reminders.md) can also be linked in
addition. In contrast to the survey module, participants automatically receive
a confirmation e-mail with the date and time of submission as well as their
completed form as a PDF attachment when they submit the completed form.

Coaches can see in the overview table in the course run which participants
have already completed the form and which have not. Forms that have already
been submitted can be reopened by the coach for further processing by the
participant, or they can be completely reset. By clicking on the participant,
the completed form can be viewed. The form data of all participants are
available as Excel export.

The use of this course element makes sense e.g. if the learners have to fill
in certain forms obligatorily, e.g. before starting a laboratory internship or
as confirmation for the independent performance of a service.
