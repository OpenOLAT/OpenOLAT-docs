# General Information

OpenOlat courses enable the mapping of various event formats e.g. lectures, seminars, online tutorials or group puzzles, as well as the implementation of different types of learning, e.g. problem-based learning, cooperative learning, self-organized learning etc. A maximum of flexibility is guaranteed by using any number of [course elements](Course_Elements.md) in any order of your choice; therefore it is easy to realize your didactic concept.

## Tip

!!! hint "Before you create your OpenOlat course"

	First think about what you want to achieve with the course.
	
	What the course looks like depends on your didactic concept, the goals and the overall framework. On this basis, you can decide whether a conventional course or a learning path course is the right choice for you. If in doubt, opt for the conventional course, as you can convert it into a learning path course at any time. The other way around is not possible.
	
	After the decision, choose the optimal and most effective course elements and try to bundle things that belong together in a meaningful way to achieve optimal usability. When the structure is clear, prepare the learning content, additional files ([HTML pages, PDF files, CPs](../learningresources/index.md), etc.) and everything you need for use in the learning platform.
