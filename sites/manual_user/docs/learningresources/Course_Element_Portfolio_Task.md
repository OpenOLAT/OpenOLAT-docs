![portfolio_434343_64.png](../assets/portfolio_434343_64.png)

By means of the course element "Portfolio task" you can provide predefined
portfolio templates to be filled by your course participants. The course
participants can then pick up the portfolio task in their course, 
and are then forwarded to their individual portfolio area. The portfolio picked up in this way can then be filled with content and artifacts by the learners and, if desired, made available to other people or the course supervisors. Depending on the configuration, these persons can also evaluate and comment on the portfolio. 
 
For the course element Portfolio task you need a "Portfolio 2.0 template",
which you link to the course element. If you have not yet created a Portfolio
Template learning resource, you can also create a new Portfolio Template or
link to a previously created one directly in the course via "Select or create
Portfolio Template".  Click [here](../portfolio/Creating_Portfolio_Tasks.md) to find out
exactly how to create a portfolio task.


If you have already added a portfolio template, it will appear under Selected
Portfolio Template. Follow the link to get to the preview. You now have the
option of selecting a different content with the "Change Portfolio Template"
button.

!!! info

    In case a portfolio template has already been downloaded and edited it will no longer be possible to replace it.

In the tab "Evaluation" you can preconfigure the display of points, status
passed/failed and individual comments. In the fields "Note for all users" and
"Note for supervisors" you formulate general information for the evaluation to
all course participants and coaches.
