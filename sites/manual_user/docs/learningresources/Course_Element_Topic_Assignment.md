# Course Element "Topic Assignment" {: #topic_assignment}

![circle.png](assets/projectbroker.png)

The course element "Topic assignment" is useful if you want to announce e.g.
topics for term papers in your course before having them supervised. Course
authors determine the detailed configuration of their topic assignment. This
comprises e.g. who has the right to announce and supervise topics, how topics
have to be described, or how many topics can be selected by one course
participant. What makes this course element so special is the fact that not
course authors but topic authors will announce and supervise such topics.

###  **How to configure topic assignments**

In the tab "Configuration" you determine first how many topics can be selected
by one participant, if this selection is definite or if it has to be accepted
by the topic author first. Furthermore you can add additional fields to
describe a topic in more detail. This description will then be displayed in
the table containing all topics announced. Here you can also determine if
registrations and submissions shall only be possible within a certain period
of time. In the tab "Sub-elements" you can choose if there should be a drop
box as well as a return box in your topic assignment. Course participants will
then upload their files to that drop box while topic authors will return those
files by means of a return box.

* **Do you want to limit the number of Topics per participant?:** 

  When
selecting this option a field will pop up to indicate the number of Topics a
participant may choose from the course element Topic assignment  
  
* **Topic authors have to accept participants:** 

  When selecting this option
participants can only register for a Topic temporarily. Topic authors will
then have to select their candidates before finally accepting them.  
When deselecting this option all participants already registered for this
  Topic will be accepted automatically. However, topic authors are able to
define the maximum number of participants first.  
  
* **Only one Topic allowed (participants accepted will be signed out automatically from other Topics):** 
 
  When selecting this option all users
accepted as participants will be automatically signed out of all other topics

a pull-down menu. Please indicate the corresponding options in the field
"Value" separated by semicolons or line breaks. When using a free-text field
you can leave the field "Value" blank. Topic authors can then fill in a value
of their own choice.

  When selecting "**Appears in table**" this field will be displayed in the overview
as requested. Apart from that this information will appear in the detailed
topic description.

  By means of "**Delete field**" you can delete additional fields.

## "Folder" and "Administration of participants" tabs

###  **How to manage participants**

If the configuration of your topic assignment requires that course
participants have to be accepted by the topic author you will see on the home
page of topic assignments the note "Check participant" in a table as soon as
somebody has applied for your topic.

![assignment_participants.png](assets/Topic_Assignement_TN_EN.png)
![assignment_participants.png](assets/Topic_Assignement_TN2_EN.png)

Now open the tab "**Topic assignment**" and accept the application of your
candidate(s).

Candidates are course participants applying for your topic. By means of
"**Accept participant as**" you can decide to whom your topic should be assigned.
All participants accepted will be added to the list "Participants accepted"
and can be notified via e-mail if you wish. Just highlight those candidates
you do not accept and click on "Delete." If you wish those candidates will be
notified via e-mail as well.

If you have not limited the number of vacancies you can repeat this procedure
several times. Please remember to select "Topic set status on "Filled" in the
tab "Description" to avoid further applications for your topic.

It is also possible to add or remove participants in this tab manually, as
well as additional topic administrators. Participants will not be allowed to
edit their Topic.

#### **How to upload and return files**

In the tab "Folder," section "Drop box," you will find all those files course
participants have submitted. In the section "Return box" you can put files
already corrected. There will be one sub-folder for each course participant.

***From the user's perspective:***

If the topic status is set to "Free", users can register for a topic, as long
as they have not exceeded the maximum possible topic selection. If the topic
status is set to "Occupied", no further users can register. If you have
already selected a topic, the topic status is either "Provisionally assigned"
if the person responsible for the topic has to accept you as a participant, or
"Assigned" if the registration is automatic. As soon as the topic owner
accepts you as a participant, the topic status is set to "Definitively
assigned".

##  Managing Topics of Topic Assignments

The course element "Topic assignment" is used within an OpenOlat course. A
course author can configure this element as needed and appoint persons
responsible for a topic. Persons responsible for topics can offer their course
participants a variety of topics before managing these participants along with
their topics. Course participants will be able to submit expositions via drop
boxes. Corrections can then be returned via return boxes.
