Use the course element "CP Learning Content" to integrate learning content in IMS-CP format (IMS-CP Version 1.1.2) into your course. You can either create the CP directly in OpenOlat, which is explained in the chapter "[Five steps to your content packaging](../resource_cp/In_Five_Steps_to_Your_Content_Package.md)". Or you can create the CP externally, for example with [eLML](http://www.elml.org "eLML ").

Further information on the CP can be found
