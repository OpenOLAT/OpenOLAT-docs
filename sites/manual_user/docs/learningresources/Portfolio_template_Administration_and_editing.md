#  Portfolio template: Administration and editing

Open in the authoring area under "My entries" the desired Portfolio 2.0 template.

If you have created a new Portfolio 2.0 template, it already contains a "section" which you can rename and further develop.

You can also create new areas and tasks for these areas.

5. Under selection choose the desired selection. The assignment will appear in this section.

## Create and edit assignments - Form
  
1. Open the portfolio template in authoring and "My entries". Select either the desired section in "Overview" or the link "New assignment" from the menu. Afterwards you can assign it to the section.
 
2. Insert short title and additionally a summary for a greater overview for the users can be created.

3. Under type choose "form".

4. Under "Select form", you can then select a previously created "Form" learning resource or create a new form. A corresponding dialog appears. If you create a new form here, you will have to call it up and design it later in the authoring area.

!!! Tip "Hint"

	The "Form" type, especially the "Rubric" question type, is particularly suitable for peer reviews, criteria-related feedback or clear evaluations.

We recommend creating the learning resource "Form" in advance and then including it in the portfolio template afterwards.    

The actual task can be entered as text in the "Task" area, uploaded and saved as a document in the "Document" area or integrated directly into the form.

5. Then it can be chosen between self and external evaluation.

	* **Self evaluation**: The user fills out a self evaluation. For example, he can assess his own competence with regard to certain aspects. An external assessment along the questionnaire, e.g. by the teacher, is not possible.

	* **Self- and external evaluation**: Self as well as external evaluations are possible. The self evaluation is not visible for the person doing the external evaluation.

	* **Invitee can see self evaluation**: With this option the self evaluation is shown to the person who does the external evaluation. The self evaluation is shown after the external evaluation is done.

	* **Anonymous external evaluation**: The external evaluations are anonymous. For the user it is not visible, who did which external evaluation.  
  
6. Under "Section", if necessary, select the desired section of the task. The task will then appear in this section.  

7. Finally Save all.  

!!! tip "Hint"

	In order for an external assessment to take place, the user must activate people for the assessment in the "Release" tab after collecting the portfolio task, e.g. all course members or course coaches or certain individual people. ![](assets/Portfolio_Freigabe_20.png)

	These people can then use the form and make ratings. Several ratings can also be displayed in a kind of spider's web.

!!! info "Note"

	The creator of a Portfolio 2.0 template always creates "tasks" and not "entries".

## Further configurations

Further configurations of the Portfolio 2.0 template learning resource are possible via the Portfolio toolbar and the "Administration" menu.

### Administration

Further settings can be made in the "Administration" menu in the "Settings" menu. In addition to the information for the info page, the setup of the release modalities and the entry in the catalog, the following further configurations can be made in the tab "Settings":

  * Allow users to create new entries (not just edit the tasks)
  
  * Allow users to delete their own folder. If you do not select this option, the users have no chance to delete the portfolio folder again.
  
  * Provide users with a template folder with additional files and/or questionnaires for selection. If you activate the template folder, you can also define whether users can only create new entries based on the template folder.

### Toolbar

In the tab "Overview" of the toolbar you can also edit the metadata of the portfolio template.
