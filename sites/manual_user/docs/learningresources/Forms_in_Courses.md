# Forms in courses

The learning resource form can be used within courses for different purposes and with different [course elements](../learningresources/Course_Elements.md).

These include:

* [Course element Survey](../learningresources/Course_Element_Survey.md)
* [Course element Form](../learningresources/Course_Element_Form.md)
* [Course element Assessment](../learningresources/Course_Element_Assessment.md)
* Part of the [Portfolio 2.0 Template](Portfolio_template_Creation.md) about the course element Portfolio task

In general, forms can also be created directly in the course via the respective course element.

!!! info "Hint"

    It is often unclear to OpenOlat authors that the forms created in the course are a _course-independent_ OpenOlat learning resource "form" that can be used in the various course elements as well as in other courses. It is therefore recommended that the learning resource is not created in the course, but in the [authoring area](../area_modules/Authoring.de.md) and then integrated into the course.

## Changes to forms and included questionnaires

Please note that once a form has been called up by a participant, the form can only be changed in a limited way.
