Via the "Blog" you can inform the participants of the course about current topics in the form of text, pictures or video. You can integrate external blogs as well as create and use a new OLAT learning resource "Blog". Course owners can, for example, maintain a blog more or less regularly in a blog and thus inform course participants about new current content on the event topic. Participants can then comment on these contributions and rate them with 1-5 stars. It is also possible to give course participants the right to write a blog, so that they can jointly run a course blog.

How to [create](../resource_blog/Four_Steps_to_Your_Blog.md) and [configure](../learningresources/Blog_Further_Configurations.md) a blog is explained on separate pages.

Similar to the podcast, the blog also serves to make new content available. In addition to text, images or films can also be included in the contributions.

Every OpenOlat user is allowed to rate and comment blog entries with 1-5 stars. To post a comment or read existing comments, click on the "Comments" link. You will also see the reviews of the other blog readers.

You _can_ create blog entries only if the course owner has authorized you to do so. Click on "Create new entry" and compose the blog entry.

## Create and edit blog entry

**Title:** Enter a title that describes the blog entry. This field is mandatory.

**Description:** The description is optional and is used as a preview of an item or entry. Thus, it can also be a short introduction or summary.

**Publishing date and time:** The publishing date and time are used to make the entry visible to other users or to hide it. If the time of publication is in the past, the entry becomes visible. If, on the other hand, it is in the future, then it is a planned publication of the entry.

You can make the entry available to others by clicking "Publish" (from the specified date). If you want to continue writing your entry at a later time, click Save Draft. "Cancel" discards your changes and closes the form window. Drafts appear with a yellow background in the list of entries. Planned publications are marked in green. All other entries are public and visible for others.

You can either publish the new entry directly, choose the date of publication or save the entry as a draft.
