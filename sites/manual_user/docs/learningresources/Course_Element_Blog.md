#  Course Element "Blog" {: #blog}

![icon blog](assets/blog.png)

Via the "Blog" you can inform the participants of the course about current
topics in the form of text, pictures or video. You can integrate external
blogs as well as create and use a new OLAT learning resource "Blog". Course
owners can, for example, maintain a blog more or less regularly in a blog and
thus inform course participants about new current content on the event topic.
Participants can then comment on these contributions and rate them with 1-5
stars. It is also possible to give course participants the right to write a
blog, so that they can jointly run a course blog.

How to [create](../resource_blog/Four_Steps_to_Your_Blog.md) and
[configure](../learningresources/Blog_Further_Configurations.md) a blog is explained on
separate pages.
