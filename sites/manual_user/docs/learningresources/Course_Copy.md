### Copy with and without wizard, exportcontent

Learning resources are copied in order to be able to reuse an old course structure for a new semester, for example. When copying a course, the structure, folder contents, HTML pages and group names (without group members) are copied. User data such as forum entries, group members, etc. are not copied. However, user data such as forum posts, group members, etc. will not be copied.
This way you get a completely reset course without user-specific data remains.

!!! tip "Hint"

    It is best to create a course copy if you want to run a course repeatedly instead of just removing the people from the member list. This way, all entries in the assessment tool are also omitted and you get a completely cleaned course.

!!! tip "Hint"

    A course copy can also usefully be created as a backup after the course has been completed and before the course begins.
