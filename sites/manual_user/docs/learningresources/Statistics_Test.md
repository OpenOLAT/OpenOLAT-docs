The test statistics allow you to perform general course-related, anonymous statistical assessments of your tests. All tests included in the course are displayed.

Both the key figures for a test and further analyses of the completion time, average points per question and the percentage of correct answers per question are displayed. Furthermore, key figures such as the number of participants who have completed the question, the average number of points and processing time etc. are displayed and visualized for each question. Using key values for test assessment and item analysis, you can assess a test in terms of difficulty and suitability, for example.

A download of the raw data and a print version are also available here.

Access to the test statistics is not only available to the course owners but also to all coaches of the course.
