# Podcast: Overview {: #overview}

In OpenOlat, podcasts are learning resources that can be created and used both independently of courses and integrated into OpenOlat courses. 

There are two types of podcasts:
a) Podcasts that are created in OpenOlaz and
b) external podcasts from the internet, which are integrated via RSS feed.

A podcast usually consists of several episodes. An episode can be an audio or video contribution. 

In the "How-to" section you can find out how to create [podcasts in courses](../../manual_how-to/podcast/podcast.md). 
Further information on configuring podcasts can be found [here](../learningresources/Podcast_Configuration.md).

## General information about Podcast

The term "Podcasting" comprises words such as "iPod" and "Broadcasting" and means producing and providing audio as well as video files. Podcasts can be subscribed to before uploading episodes either by means of online services such as iTunes to mobile devices or using them directly within OpenOlat. Such episodes will be shown sorted by time; the latest news will always appear on top. Course participants will be able to assess episodes and comment on them.

    An advantage of podcasts is that media data can easily be provided and used regardless of location. Additionally you can produce as well as use episodes independently of any broadcasting time compared to radio shows.

## The learning resource podcast

The podcast learning resource can be created directly in the author area. All podcast learning resources that you have created yourself or for which you are the owner are displayed under "My entries". 

In the "Administration" -> "Settings" section of the podcast learning resource, you can also create a booking configuration for the learning resource or assign specific members.
If the podcast is integrated into a course, an additional release or assignment of additional members is _not necessary_. The "Private" setting and the "Preparation" status are sufficient for the learning resource, as rights management is handled via the course.
