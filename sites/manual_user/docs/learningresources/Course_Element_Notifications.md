# Course Element "Notifications" {: #notification}

![notification.png](assets/infomessage.png)

This course element allows you to embed notifications in your course
structure. These notifications will be visible in your course as well as in
the notifications section (Personal tools -> Subscriptions) of each single user. The message can either be a
short info text or an extensive information which is added as attachment (max.
5 MB). 

During the creation of the notification it can be defined, if the
message should be sent by email to certain user groups of the course
(subscribers, course owners, coaches, members, groups) additionally.

## Configuration in the course editor Tab "Mitteilungs-Konfiguration"

 **Display:** The maximum number of days determines how long notifications
shall be displayed in your course (in days). The maximum number of messages
determines how many messages shall be displayed simultaneously in your course.

 **Subscribe automatically:** By default this course element will be
automatically subscribed. This option can be deactivated here so that course
participants will be able to subscribe to notifications manually.

By default only course authors and moderators are allowed to create messages.
However, all course participants may read messages. In the tab "Notification
configuration" you can adjust this setting according to your wishes.

!!! info

    The number of characters for the message is limited to 32,000. You will
    receive information about the number of characters already used in the lower
    right corner of the message editor. If the permitted number of characters is
    exceeded, a corresponding message is displayed. Note: The number of actual
    characters specified differs from the number of visible characters, as the
    actual number of HTML code is used.

!!! tip "Tip"

    An element with similar functions, but without specific configuration, can also be found in the toolbar. This is the "[Participant Info](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md)".
