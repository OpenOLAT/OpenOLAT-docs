This course element allows you to link to e-books from Edubase. The e-books can then be opened in OpenOlat.

A prerequisite for using this course element is an Edubase account, plus the allowance to use a specific e-book. Clients of frentix please contact [edubase@frentix.com](mailto:edubase@frentix.com)[.](mailto:contact@frentix.com). Non-clients please contact [Edubase](https://www.edubase.ch/) directly.

!!! info "Info"

    The module must first be activated and configured in the administration, and authorization keys for the eBooks are also required. As soon as the pre-settings are done, the course element can be added in OpenOlat. By using the editor, you can define specific reading orders for the users for an embedded e-book.
