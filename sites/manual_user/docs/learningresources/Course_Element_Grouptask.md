# Course Element "Group Task" {: #course_element_group_tasks}

![Task Icon](assets/task.png)

The course element Group task functions largely like the course element [Task](Course_Element_Task.md). 

Points and feedbacks are created for the whole group in this course element, but can be customized.

The following differences to the course element Task should be noted:

When creating the group task, one or more groups to which the task is assigned
must be selected in the tab "Workflow". Only these groups can then view and
edit the task. As long as no group has been assigned, the course element is
not visible when the editor is closed.

When the editor is closed, the tab "All participants" does not show the
individual persons directly, but the assigned groups are shown, which can then
be selected and evaluated. Within the evaluation process it can be decided
whether the evaluation is valid for the entire group or whether the evaluation
is only valid for a certain group member.
