# Performance assessment

## Assessment

A number of course elements can be used either for summative or formative assessment, or serves as performance control tool. The following course elements can be viewed and assessed in the [assessment tool](../learningresources/Using_Course_Tools.md#UsingCourseTools-_bewertungswerkzeug). Further information on these modules can be found, among other things, in the chapter ["Assessment"](../learningresources/Assessment.md):

* [Task](../learningresources/Assessment.md) (manual assessment)
  [Grouptask](../learningresources/Assessment.md)(Manual assessment)

Refer to the chapter ["Test"](../learningresources/Test.md) for more information on creating and configuring tests.

## Evidence of Achievement & Certificate

An evidence of achievement is a confirmation of an existing efficiency control and shows e.g. taken tests or assessed tasks per course. Certificates of achievement must be activated for each course and can be retrieved if there are assessable course elements in the course and one such course element has already been completed and assessed.Performance records are available to users in the personal menu and in the course, while coaches can access them in the [Coaching](../area_modules/Coaching.md) tool. Printable certificates can be issued with the course setting ["Evidence of achievements"](../learningresources/Course_Settings.md).
