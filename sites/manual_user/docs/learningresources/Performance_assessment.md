## Evidence of Achievement & Certificate

An evidence of achievement is a confirmation of an existing efficiency control and shows e.g. taken tests or assessed tasks per course. An evidence of achievement must be activated for each single course, and are accessible once there are a) assessable course elements and b) one of those course elements has been completed and assessed. Users can access their personal evidences of achievements in the personal menu and the course, while coaches and authors can review those of coached users in the [Coaching](../area_modules/Coaching.de.md) tool. Printable certificates can be issued with the course setting ["Evidence of achievements"](../learningresources/Course_Settings.md).

All your evidences of achievement and certificates will be listed in your ["Evidence of achievements"](../learningresources/Course_Settings.md). It always opens in a new window and is printable.
