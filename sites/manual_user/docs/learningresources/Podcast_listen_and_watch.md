## Create episodes {: #_create_episode}

With the "Create contributions" right, participants can also create episodes and thus upload audio and videos.

!!! info "Important"

    An initial video must be available so that learners can add their own audio or video episodes. For example, the teacher could upload an initial audio/video and briefly explain what the learners should do in the podcast or introduce the topic with exciting reflection questions.
