The course element Appointment Scheduling can be used to organize enrollments
for specific appointments as well as to find appointments. In general, you can
configure whether multiple appointments can be selected, whether there is a
limit to the number of participants, whether participants can see who has
registered and whether a BigBlueButton room should be assigned.

In the course editor, the course element is added and it can be determined
whether coaches can also edit occasions and appointments or whether this is
only possible by the course owners. If the choice of appointments should only
be possible within a certain time window, the time specifications in the
course editor must be specified accordingly in the tab "Learning path" or, in
the case of conventional courses, the visibility or access must be configured
appropriately.

However, the actual configuration and setup of the dates is done in the course
run with the editor closed. For this purpose, a new enrollment or appointment
is first created via the button "Create occasion" and the basic configuration
is carried out as well as appointments are entered.

How to configure an appointment booking or an appointment finding:

 **Title:** Enter the name of the appointment here, e.g. "Reconciliation
closing meeting", "Kick-off meeting" etc.. The entry is required (mandatory
field).

 **Description:** Explain the appointment selection in more detail.

 **Type:** Decide if it is a date determination for a common date or an
enrollment for one or more dates from a selection, e.g. lab dates.

 **Configuration:** Decide whether the participants are allowed to select only
one or several appointments and whether the names of the participants are
visible for other participants. In the case of "Appointment booking", you can also
define whether the organizer have to confirm the appointment.

event.

 **Max. Participants:** You can limit the number of members for an appointment
(only for "Enrollment").
