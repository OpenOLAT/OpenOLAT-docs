# General information on forms

Typical for forms is that they consist of an information element, one or more questions and provide the user with an action option. For example, something can be checked or a selection can be made or own text can be inserted. Depending on the implementation and further integration into a course, the information is anonymous or personal.

In forms many different question types like rubric, single selection, multiple selection, text input and file upload are available. Each form consists of a page with one or more questions or elements. Branching is also possible via Question rules.

If a form is published as a stand-alone version, i.e. independently of an online course, it can be viewed and completed, but not saved or submitted. This means that it is only used for demonstration purposes and does not fulfill the full functionality of a form.

If you want people to be able to fill in and submit a form and you as the author to see the results, you must include it in an [OpenOlat course](Forms_in_Courses.md).
