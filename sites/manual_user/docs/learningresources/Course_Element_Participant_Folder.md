The course element "Participant folder" allows you to exchange files between
participants and coaches. With the creation of the course element there are
two folders available. On one side this is the drop box where participants can
upload files for the coaches. On the other side it is the return box where
coaches can upload files for all participants together or individually.
Im Prinzip verbergen sich hinter diesem Kursbaustein zwei (Kursbaustein) Ordner einmal mit Schreibberechtigung und einmal ohne, die jedoch nur f√ºr Betreuende und einen einzelnen Teilnehmer sichtbar sind. 

!!! info

    A similar configuration of file delivery + file return by coaches can also be     implemented with the course element ["Task"](Course_Element_Task.md), only that the possibilities of the task element are much more comprehensive and complex and here also an evaluation or allocation of points can be made.

## Folder settings
In the folder settings configurations for the drop box and the return box can be made. By default both folders are enabled and delete and override is enabled for the participants. For the drop box some more configurations can be made.

Delete and override can be unenabled. This means that the participants cannot delete any files. Uploaded files stay in the drop box coercively. Further a time interval can be defined. The upload in the drop box is only possible in this time frame. Out of this time frame files can only be downloaded.

If the participant's folder is activated, the participants can upload files or create them directly in OpenOlat. If the administrator of the OpenOlat instance has activated further document editors, it is also possible to create further file formats such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint files.
In the folder settings configurations for the drop box and the return box can
be made. By default both folders are enabled and delete and override is enabled for the participants. 

Additionally the number of files can be limited. As soon as this number is reached no writing tools are available anymore. This means that uploaded files cannot be moved, copied, zipped or unzipped anymore. But they can be deleted, if this option is enabled. If desired only the drop box or only the return box can be enabled.

In the Template Settings tab, subfolders can also be created for both the Submission and Return folders to create a continuous folder structure. For example, a return folder could include a subfolder for content feedback and one for supplemental files, or a submission folder could reflect some desired structure for the submissions. 
  

!!! warning "Attention"

    As for all upload areas, there is a memory limit for the participant folder. The file upload limits set by the administrator and the entire folder limit are displayed when you try to upload a file.


## Tab Template Einstellungen

In the Template Settings tab, subfolders can be created for both the submission folder and the return folder, creating a continuous folder structure for all participants. For example, a return folder could include a subfolder for content feedback and one for supplemental files, or a submission folder could reflect some desired structure for the submissions. 

!!! warning 

    The subfolders created here cannot be renamed later. Only a deletion and a new creation is possible. In the course run, when you try to rename these subfolders, copies of the subfolders with new names will be created.
