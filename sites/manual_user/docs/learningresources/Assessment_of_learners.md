## Bulk assessment

The course elements ["Task"](Assessing_tasks_and_group_tasks.md) and ["Assessment"](Assessment_of_course_modules.md) also offer the possibility of bulk assessment.

If you want to assess all or many users at once, you can start a "New bulk assessment". To do this, create an assessment in a spreadsheet program and paste the data into the mass assessment field using copy+paste. You can find more information about bulk assessment in the [How to](../../manual_how-to/bulk_assessment/bulk_assessment.md) area.

## Filter options

Filters can be used for the entire course as well as for course elements to generate an overview of specific groups of people and then evaluate them. For example, the members of a certain group, all persons who have not yet passed the course or course element, or only the members of a certain institution can be displayed in a filtered manner and then specifically evaluated.
