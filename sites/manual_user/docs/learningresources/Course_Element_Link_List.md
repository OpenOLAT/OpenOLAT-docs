The course element "Link list" enables the author to quickly assemble a collection of links relevant to the course. No HTML proficiency is required. Simply open the course editor, navigate to the link list course element, open the "Configuration" tab and enter either the URL of the website you wish to add as a link, or select a target file by clicking on the magnifier icon. You can upload files in the now open modal window. Next, select whether the link should open in a new or in the same window, and enter the title of the link. A description or other additional information on the link can be added through the comment field, located beneath the address field. Remove or add links by using the trash / + buttons.
