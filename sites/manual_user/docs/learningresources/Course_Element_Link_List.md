The course element "Link list" enables the author to quickly assemble a
collection of links relevant to the course. No HTML proficiency is required.
Simply open the course editor, navigate to the link list course element, open
the "Configuration" tab and enter either the URL of the website you wish to
add as a link, or select a target file by clicking on the magnifier icon. You
can upload files in the now open modal window. Next, select whether the link
should open in a new or in the same window, and enter the title of the link. A
description or other additional information on the link can be added through
the comment field, located beneath the address field. Remove or add links by
using the trash / + buttons.
