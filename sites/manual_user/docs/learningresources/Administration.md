If you have selected a course as **author**, the "Administration" button is displayed at the top left. There you will find all options for **editing, configuration and administration** of the selected course. (Before and during use of the course.) The most important options for authors include the [course editor](#course_editor) and the [settings](#settings).

**The "Administration" button is also available for coaches. However, fewer options are then displayed, and only those relevant to coaches. In particular, for example, the [assessment tool](#assessment_tool).

!!! info "Note"

    Some options are only available if the corresponding feature has been activated. If necessary, please contact your administrator.


Other learning resources also have the "Administration" menu, but the menu options there are not as extensive. They vary depending on the learning resource.

Below you will find an overview of the "Administration" menu options for **Courses**.
