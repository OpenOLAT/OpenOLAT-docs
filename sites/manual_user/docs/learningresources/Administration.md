# Overview: Course Administration

You have granted access to your course; course participants are already working on your learning content. This chapter explains which tools can be used by course authors during course operation, which additional features are at their disposal and how they can archive course activities.

You control most of the central settings via the tools that you find in the [administration](Using_Course_Tools.md) of the course or the respective learning resource:

 * [Members management](Members_management.md) for organizing participants, groups, etc.
 * [Storage folder](Storage_folder.md) in the menu "Files" for storing and organizing course-specific files
 * [Assessment tool - overview](Assessment_tool_overview.md) for scoring, providing feedback, and organizing assessment course components 
 * [Lectures and absences](Lectures_and_absences.md) for the organization of absences of the participants
 * [Reminders](Course_Reminders.md) for sending reminders e.g. regarding assessment dates
 * [Archiving & Reporting](Data_archiving.md) for securing course results and other things.

The use of other course functions of the [Toolbar](Using_Additional_Course_Features.md) is also explained in this chapter.
