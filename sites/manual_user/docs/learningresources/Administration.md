If you have selected a course as **author**, the "Administration" button is displayed at the top left. There you will find all options for **editing, configuration and administration** of the selected course. (Before and during use of the course.) The most important options for authors include the [course editor](#course_editor) and the [settings](#settings).

**The "Administration" button is also available for coaches. However, fewer options are then displayed, and only those relevant to coaches. In particular, for example, the [assessment tool](#assessment_tool).

!!! info "Note"

    Some options are only available if the corresponding feature has been activated. If necessary, please contact your administrator.


Other learning resources also have the "Administration" menu, but the menu options there are not as extensive. They vary depending on the learning resource.

Below you will find an overview of the "Administration" menu options for **courses**.

## Convert to learning path course

![22_green_24.png](assets/22_green_24.png){ class=" aside-left-lg" }

Conventional courses (including all courses created before OpenOlat version 15) can be converted into a learning path course using this tool.

The function is only available for conventional courses.

!!! info

    If the course is only to be transferred to the current format, the “With learning progress” option is usually the better choice. In this case, the course structure does not have to be edited in a fixed order, which is more in line with the hypermedia structure of the previous course. If necessary, this setting can also be adjusted retrospectively in the course editor of the copied course at the top course element. 
    
    Please note that guests do not have access to learning path courses.
