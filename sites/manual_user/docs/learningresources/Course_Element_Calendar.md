Specialty / Note |



By means of the course element "Calendar" you can embed a course calendar in
the course structure. It is also possible to add several instances of the same
calendar to the course.

This course element offers an alternative view on the course calendar to be
found in the course toolbar (see "[Using additional course
features](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md)"). Only course authors and
moderators are allowed to create calendar entries by default. However, all
course participants are able to read entries.

In the tab "Calendar configuration" you can define whether participants and
tutors of a course may also set and edit calendar entries. Also you can decide
which date should be displayed when a course calendar is activated from the
course structure. Course calendars will automatically be added to the
[personal calendars](../personal_menu/Calendar.md) of the course members.

When displaying a certain semester week in your calendar and inserting links
on course elements, that calendar will serve as a kind of overview showing all
events and tasks of that week.

Check whether the course element "Calendar" is really the optimal choice for
you. In many cases, especially with [learning path
courses](../learningresources/Learning_path_course.md), it makes more sense to activate the
calendar in the [toolbar](../learningresources/Using_Additional_Course_Features.md) in the
settings.

    If you can't find the "Calendar" course element in the course editor, it was disabled by a system administrator.
