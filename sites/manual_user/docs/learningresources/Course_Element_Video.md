Use the course element "Video" to embed a video in MPEG-4 format (.mp4) into your course. The video must be created externally and be available as a file or via URL as a learning resource "Video" in OpenOlat.

One video per course element is linked. Depending on the configuration, the video can also be annotated and evaluated and thus optimally integrated into the teaching-learning process of a course.

If it is an interactive video, further actions such as answering quiz questions or calling up links are also possible.

For information on post-processing the video with OpenOlat quizzes and skip marks, see the "[Learning resource: Video](../learningresources/Learning_resource_Video.md)" chapter.

## Assign new video

Go to the course editor and add the course element "Video" to your course.

If you have not yet assigned a video, the message _No video selected_ appears at the title **Selected video**. Click on "Select or import video" in the "Learning content" tab to assign a video to your course element.

A new menu appears. Under "All entries" you can see all videos of the system that you can embed. Under "My entries" you can see the video learning resources you are an owner of. Select the video you want. A search is also possible.

Click "Import" or "Import URL" to upload or link to a *new* video. Alternatively, you can create a new video learning resource in the [Authoring Area](../area_modules/Authoring.md).

## Configure added video

Once you add a video, its name appears as a link. Follow the link to get to the preview of the video.

Under "Show video elements", annotations, segments, quizzes and comments, if added in the learning resource video, can also be activated.

Once you have selected or imported a video, the following section appears in the Learning content tab
**Options**. Here you can define:

* Whether viewers may comment on and/or rate the video
* whether the video should be started automatically or not
* whether to restrict fast forward or not
* whether to display the video title from the learning resource
* whether to display a description of the video. You can either use the description from the info of the learning resource video, add a new description or omit it completely.

If the title and description are enabled, they will be displayed below the video.

To change the assignment of a video afterwards and select a different video, click on "Change video" in the "Learning content" tab and then select a different video.

!!! info "Info"

    In learning path courses, the tab "Learning path" can also be used to define as a completion criterion whether learners have to finish watching the video (95%) for the course element to be considered completed.

In addition, all videos that are created in OpenOlat as learning resources and included in the course can be further configured. For example, a start image (poster) can be defined, chapter marks can be set or quiz questions can be added. The individual possibilities are explained in the chapter "[Learning resource: Video](Learning_resource_Video.md)".

## Type of integration in the course

A video that has been integrated into a course with the help of the course element video enables - in contrast to videos that are embedded via the [course element "Single Page"](Single_Page_Add_edit_video.md):

  * playback with subtitles
  * playback in different resolutions (especially relevant for mobile devices, or without Wifi access)
  * Comments
  * Assessments
  * a start image as desired
  * Combination with specific completion criteria in [Learning path courses](../learningresources/Learning_path_course.md)
