# Videos: Overview

The "Video" chapter explains to course authors how to 

* record videos in OpenOlat yourself, import them or insert them as a link,
* create videos as a learning resource,
* integrate and configure videos in a course.
* It is also important to know where and how the videos are saved.


### Directly integrated
Videos can be **directly integrated** as mp4 files or links. E.g. in the [course element "HTML page"](Course_Element_Single_Page.md) or in the feedback for a question.

### Video learning resource
Additional features can be added to the mp4 files in the OpenOlat video editor. This turns it into a [**video learning resource**](Learning_resource_Video.md), which contains annotations and quiz questions, for example. (These features can also be added to linked videos).

### Learning resource in a course element
The video learning resources can be **integrated into course elements** and provided with further configurations there. E.g. in the [course element "Video"](Course_Element_Video.md) or [course element "Video task"](Course_Element_Video_Task.md).

<br>

| Variant | Characteristic | Usage  |
| ----------|----------|------------|
| **directly integrated**  | mp4 file (uploaded)<br> or linked (Youtube and other)<br>(without additives) | in the HTML editor<br> (HTML page, feedbacks, etc.)  
| **video learning resource** | with annotations, quizzes,... <br>editable via authoring area,<br>with uploaded or linked video files | in course element video, in course element video task
| **learning resource in a course element** | a course element is container for a learning resource<br> with own, superordinated configuration | in a course


### Where are the videos stored?
* Videos in the course element "**HTML page**" are stored in the **storage folder** of the course. From there, they are linked to the course element. Videos embedded in this way are only available in the respective course.

* Instead of storing videos in the storage folder of a course, they can also be stored in a [**resource folder**](../learningresources/Course_Settings.md#ressourcenordner-einbinden). Included resource folders can then be used in several courses.

* Videos can be found as **learning resources** in the [**authoring area**](../area_modules/Authoring.md).

* In addition, videos can also be stored in the [**Media Center**](../personal_menu/Media_Center.md).
