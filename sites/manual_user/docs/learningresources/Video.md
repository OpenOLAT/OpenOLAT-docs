# Creating Videos

  * [Learning resource: Video](Learning_resource_Video.md)

  * [Single Page: Add / edit video](Single_Page_Add_edit_video.md)
  * [Video Upload](Video_Upload.md)

  

The chapter "Creating Video" explains course authors how to create videos as
learning resource in OpenOlat and how to integrate them into a course. Here
you will find information on how videos can be configured. Furthermore you
will find information on how to embed videos in individual course pages and
how to prepare videos for import in OpenOlat under "[Single Page: Add/edit
video](Single_Page_Add_edit_video.md)".

In OpenOlat videos can be implemented in different ways:

  * as  **learning resource**. The video is created in the [authoring](../authoring/Various_Types_of_Learning_Resources.md) via the option "Import" or "Import URL" and then appears as an independent learning resource "Video". Information on the video learning resource and "Video Collection" can be found on the "[Learning Resource: Video](Learning_resource_Video.md)" page.
  *  **embedded in a single page** , where videos uploaded as a file can be linked. Further information for the embedding of videos in the [course element single page](../course_elements/Course_Element_Single_Page.md) you can find on the page. Videos embedded this way are only available in the course where the video is embedded in the corresponding storage folder. Instead of storing videos in the storage folder of a course, they can also be stored in a [resource folder](../course_create/Course_Settings.md#CourseSettings-_detail_ressourcen).  Included resource folders can be used in multiple courses.
  * directly as a **file** via the course element "Single page"
  * with the **course element Podcast**
  * als spezifische Aufgabe Ã¼ber den den **Kursbaustein Video-Aufgabe**
