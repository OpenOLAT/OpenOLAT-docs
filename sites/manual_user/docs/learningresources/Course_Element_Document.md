# Course Element "Document" {: #document}

![icon document](assets/document_icon.jpg)

By means of the course element "Document" different document formats can be
integrated directly into the course. This course element is especially
suitable for Office documents, PDF or the display of graphic files. It is
possible to access already existing files or to upload or create new files.
Word processing documents and PDF are directly displayed by using the
integrated Document Viewer.

Files that are located in the course's storage folder or uploaded as separate
learning resource can be used. Which file formats can be newly created depends
on the settings in the administration of the respective OpenOlat instance.

The integrated documents can later be edited, exchanged or saved as a separate
learning resource. Depending on the file type, other options such as editing
metadata are also possible. Editing of text documents is also possible when
the corresponding licenses are activated in the OpenOlat Administration, the
editor then opens in a separate window.

Furthermore you can set user rights for your course element in the course
editor and thus define which roles are allowed to edit and download the
respective document (if possible).

The height of the display area can also be defined.

After downloading a corresponding document, the metadata shows who edited the
document last.
