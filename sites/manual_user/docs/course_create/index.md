## Creating Courses

![](assets/create_course_16.jpg)

This chapter is written for course authors and shows you the way to your own
course. There are two variants of OpenOlat courses: Conventional courses and
Learning path courses, which differ partly in the configuration options.

Learning path courses have, among other things, a [progress
indicator](Learning+path+course+-+Participant+view.html), whereas conventional
courses are suitable for more complex scenarios with more differentiated
selective approvals. In the authoring area, course owners can directly display
whether a course is a learning path course or a conventional course by
displaying the "Technical type" column.

### How can you get started?

It is best to first get an overview of the entire course cycle and then go on
to look at the individual areas. The specific course elements you can use to
build courses are explained in detail in a separate chapter.

The course structure is created in the course editor for both learning path
courses and conventional courses.  

Additionally, when creating a course, a wizard for beginners or a special exam
course can be created. For most teaching scenarios, however, the default
setting without a wizard is the appropriate choice.

  
The concrete [course elements](Types+of+Course+Element.html) that you can use
to set up courses are explained in detail in a separate chapter.
