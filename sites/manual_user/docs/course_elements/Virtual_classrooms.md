# Virtual classrooms

Virtual classrooms offer the possibility of voice- and video-based synchronous
communication and content mediation.  They are suitable for online
presentations, webinars, video conferences, online workshops, virtual group
work, etc.

In OpenOlat different virtual classrooms, also known as web conferencing
tools, can be integrated. As a rule, an OpenOlat-wide license and an
appropriate hosting server are required to use these systems. If this is the
case, the desired software can be activated in the OpenOlat Administration.
Afterwards, OpenOlat authors can use corresponding virtual classrooms as
course elements in courses.

The following virtual classrooms can be integrated in OpenOlat as external
tools:

  * [Adobe Connect](Course_element_Adobe_Connect.md)
  * [BigBlueButton](Course_element_BigBlueButton.md)
  * [GoTo Meeting](Course+element+GoToMeeting.html)
  * [OpenMeetings](Course+element+OpenMeetings.html)
  * [Vitero](Course+element+vitero.html)

Typically, the following functions are available in virtual classrooms:

  * Area for presentation files (presentation slides)
  * Text chat
  * Whiteboard functions
  * Audio and Video option
  * Screen sharing
  * Interactions such as surveys
  * Recording possibility

The exact functional scope, however, depends on the concrete external
software.

Virtual classrooms can be used for:

  * Presentations: Lectures, group presentations, presentations, lectures
  * Cooperative virtual group work
  * Online consultation hours
  * Thematic webinars and webinar series
  * and other synchronous, virtual meetings

## General configuration - Add course element

As soon as the respective Virtual Classroom is activated in the
administration, the corresponding course element is available in OpenOlat
courses and OpenOlat authors can add and configure one or more Virtual
Classrooms to a course. The respective configuration depends on the selected
tool.
