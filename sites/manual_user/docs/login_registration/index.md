## Registration

The kind of the first registration as well as the concrete procedure varies depending on the
OpenOlat instance:

* In most cases you were already registeres as user by your administrator or user manager as OpenOlat user, befor you got access to a specific course.
* But it is also possible to allow and configure self registration in OpenOlat.

Usually the procedure is visible on the corresponding OpenOlat login page. In the case of dubieties or queries please contact the local OpenOlat support of your organization. Concerning your first
OpenOlat registration, please contact the manager responsible for e-learning
in your organization.

After successful registration you will be directed to the systemwide landing
page, which can differ between systems and also between OpenOlat authors and
users. 

Further information on how to set your personal landing can be found in
[Settings](../personal_menu/Configuration.md#general).
