# Login and Registration

To use OpenOlat to its full extent, you must be registered in OpenOlat. You can only use OpenOlat anonymously as a guest with limited possibilities. 

Each time you start OpenOlat, the [login page](Login_Page.md) appears, where you can log in. You can read more about the different login methods in this chapter.

About logout and timeout you can find some information [here](../basic_concepts/Session_Timeout_and_Logout.md).



## Your first OpenOlat registration

In order to work with OpenOlat you need an internet connection as well as a
[browser](Login_Page.md#LoginPage-login_browsercheck). The kind of the first
registration as well as the concrete procedure varies depending on the
OpenOlat instance. However, usually the procedure is visible on the
corresponding OpenOlat login page. In the case of dubieties or queries please
contact the local OpenOlat support of your organization. Concerning your first
OpenOlat registration, please contact the manager responsible for e-learning
in your organization.

After successful registration you will be directed to the systemwide landing
page, which can differ between systems and also between OpenOlat authors and
users. 

Further information on how to set your personal landing can be found in
[Settings](../personal_menu/Configuration.md#general).
