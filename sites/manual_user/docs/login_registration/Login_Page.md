## Guest Access

You can use OpenOlat as a guest as well. The so-called guest access provides an
insight into OpenOlat with limited access to certain features: you will only
have access to learning content that is explicitly open to the public. In order to
have access to other material and activities you will have to register first.
Further information to the guest access can be found
[here](../basic_concepts/guest_access.md).

## Browser Check {: #browsercheck}

OpenOlat is optimized for the following browser software (mobile or desktop):

  * [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
  * [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)
  * [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
  * [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)

Internet Explorer in version 6 to 11 by Microsoft is not fully
supported anymore. Microsoft dropped support for these versions, and security
updates are no longer provided for. Should you use an older browser which is
not supported anymore the corresponding warning will be shown by the login.
Then you can use OpenOlat at your own risk or update your browser. This
warning can be hidden through CSS by your system administrator.  

## Cookies & Javascript

In any case, your browser must accept session cookies, and Javascript must be
enabled.

## After login

After your login you will navigate either to 

* your personal homepage in OpenOlat, 
* an info page, a page which usually contains general information on various topics, 
* to the portal or 
* a landing page defined by you. 

!!! Info

    If you cannot see the portal it was most probably disabled by the system administrator.
