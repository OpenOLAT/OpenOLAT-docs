This chapter explains how course authors can create tasks for single course
participants and groups. Here you will find an step-by-step instruction as
well as information on how to adapt tasks according to your needs. With the
help of these two course elements, the flow of submitted assignments,
including feedback and sample solutions, can be mapped. The group task element
has the same structure and functionality as the individual task element.

The tasks of a course are created and configured in the course editor.
