## Evidence of Achievement & Certificate

An evidence of achievement is a confirmation of an existing efficiency control
and shows e.g. taken tests or assessed tasks per course. An evidence of
achievement must be activated for each single course, and are accessible once
there are a) assessable course elements and b) one of those course elements
has been completed and assessed. Users can access their personal evidences of
achievements in the personal menu and the course, while coaches and authors
can review those of coached users in the [Coaching](Coaching.de.md) tool.
Printable certificates can be issued with the course setting "[Evidence of
achievements](../course_create/Course_Settings.md#CourseSettings-_leistungsnachweis)".

All your evidences of achievement and certificates will be listed in your
["Evidence of achievements"](Personal+Menu.html#PersonalMenu-
_leistungsnachweise). It always opens in a new window and is printable.
