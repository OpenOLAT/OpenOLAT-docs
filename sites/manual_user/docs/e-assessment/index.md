OpenOlat allows the implementation of various performance and achievement
controls. Beside the course elements designed for [knowledge
transfer](Knowledge+Transfer.html) or
[collaboration](Communication+and+Collaboration.html), there are a number of
course elements with the sole purpose of performance control and
[assessment](Assessment.html). These are again subdivided into two types:
there those with a formative character, best suited to be used collaterally in
a course or semester, such as the task, the portfolio task or the checklist.
On the other hand are the tests, selectively used for primarily summative
assessment.

In this chapter you will learn what the assessment mode is and where to find
it, which course elements can be used for assessing course participants, and
how best to use the coaching tool. Information on how the assessment mode
affects a students access to OpenOlat can be found under
"[Exams](Exams.html)".
