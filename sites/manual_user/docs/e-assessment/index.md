OpenOlat allows the implementation of various performance and achievementcontrols. Beside the course elements designed for [knowledge transfer](../learningresources/Knowledge_Transfer.md) or
[collaboration](../learningresources/Communication_and_Collaboration.md), there are a number of course elements with the sole purpose of performance control and [assessment](../learningresources/Assessment.md). These are again subdivided into two types: there those with a formative character, best suited to be used collaterally in a course or semester, such as the task, the portfolio task or the checklist. On the other hand are the tests, selectively used for primarily summative assessment.

In this chapter you will learn what the assessment mode is and where to find it, which course elements can be used for assessing course participants, and how best to use the coaching tool. Information on how the assessment mode affects a students access to OpenOlat can be found under
[Exams](../learningresources/Exams.md).
