Relating to the shared binders three tabs are available.

In "Binders" all binders shared with the corresponding user are shown. Here it
is visible in which status the binder stands. Additionally removing shared
binders is possible. It is also possible to filter by binders with sections
still open.

In the Tab "Entries/To do" all entries which require an action of the user are
shown. Also a marking of favorites is possible here.

In the tab "Favorites" all entries which have been marked as favorite by the
user are shown. The favorites can also be filtered according to their status
(draft, in revision, published or closed).

As usual, the columns in the three tabs can be hidden or shown as desired.
