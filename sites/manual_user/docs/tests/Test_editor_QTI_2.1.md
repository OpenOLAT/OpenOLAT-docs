# Test editor QTI 2.1

The QTI 2.1 format is used in OpenOlat to create tests. A detailed description
of this QTI specification can be found on the [IMS](http://www.imsglobal.org/)
website. Creating and saving the tests in a standard format makes it possible
to use them as course elements in different OpenOlat courses on the one hand,
and to use them in different LMS supporting the same version of the IMS QTI
format on the other.

If there are questions in the older format QTI 1.2 (e.g. from an old OpenOlat
version) they can be [converted](Changing+from+QTI+1.2+to+QTI+2.1.html).
Information on how to quickly create a test can be found
[here](Four+Steps+to+Your+Test+or+Self-test.html).

Tests created in OpenOlat can also be exported as Word files. Click on "Export
as Word file" under Export in the Test Editor. The test is then downloaded in
Zip format with two Word files, one of which contains only the questions, the
other the solutions. The exported file contains all important information
about the test including the score, so that you can use the document directly
for offline tests.

On the following pages you will learn in detail which possibilities and
settings the OpenOlat test editor offers:

  * [Test question types](Test+question+types.html)
  * [Configure test questions](Configure+test+questions.html)
  * [Configure tests](Configure+tests.html)
