## Questions in tests

In the Reports section, administrators can search for specific test questions.
For example, all questions by an author or a specific title can be displayed.

## Certificates

Here it is possible to search for specific certificates, e.g. all certificates
for a specific date or a specific course. After the search, the matching
report can be downloaded. This gives an overview of all people who have passed
the certificate for the respective search criteria.
