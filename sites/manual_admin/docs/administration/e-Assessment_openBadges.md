# OpenBadges

OpenBadges are implemented after the OpenBadges standard and fully compatible with it. More information [here](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/openbadges).

## Configuration

* Turn Badges on/off for the whole instance of your OpenOlat.

## Templates

A standard set of templates is already instantiated on the OpenOlat instance. Additional templates can be created by specifying the image, name and a description of the template.

### Name

Is the display name of the template and is displayed in the wizard.

### Categories

Here you can divide the templates into categories. Badge templates with the same category are displayed in the same tab in the wizard.

### Area of application

The scope defines whether a badge should be available globally (for issuing at instance level) or for courses.

## Global Badges

Global badges can be viewed here. The status (active / in preparation) and whether they have already been awarded. They can also be edited and deleted. Global badges are not linked to a course and can be assigned manually.

## Creating and editing a badge

1. **Template**: The first step is to select a template or upload your own image. SVG is currently supported.

## Usage of Badges

Badges are awarded by course owners in each course under<br>
**Settings > Tab Assessment > Section Badges**. <br>
The right to assign manually can also be given to coaches.

If badges have been activated, the **Badges** option will be available in **Course administration** after the next login. The badge allocation rules for the course can be set up here.

The automatically assigned badges can then be viewed or manually assigned in the **evaluation tool**.

For course participants, acquired badges are listed in the personal menu. You can find more information [here](../../manual_user/personal_menu/OpenBadges.md)
