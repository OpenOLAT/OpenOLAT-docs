# Anonymous guests and external users

In addition to registered users, OpenOlat can also be used by

* **Guests** (anonymous, can only use the offers available to guests)
* **External users** (at least known by e-mail, are only invited by e-mail to a very specific course/group/portfolio/project)

Administrators can determine whether and to what extent OpenOlat can be used in this way.
