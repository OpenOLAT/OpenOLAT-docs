## Taxonomy {: #taxonomy}

All contents of the media center can be assigned to a taxonomy (meta data). Since OpenOlat can manage multiple taxonomies at the same time, it must be determined in the administration, which taxonomies should be used in the media center.

You can find further information in the chapter [Taxonomy](../administration/Modules_Taxonomy.md).

## Shares {: #shares}

If contents are deposited in the media center, they can be shared for others to use (Share). Which share options are available to authors and other roles can be determined by administrator in the tab "Share".

Author view:<br>

Administrative users, such as learning resource managers and administrators, have **indirect** access to media due to their higher-level roles. They have **administrative access** to all media shared within their organisation, groups, courses, and with users.

To better distinguish administrative access, the ‘Media Management’ section is available in addition to the ‘My Media Centre’ section.
(Users without administrative access will not see this tab.)
