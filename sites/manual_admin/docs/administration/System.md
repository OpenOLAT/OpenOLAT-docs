#  [System](System.html)

In the System section of the OpenOlat Administration, administrators can
obtain general information about the system runtime, such as the quota used,
current click numbers or data directories. In addition, administrators have
access to the areas:

  * Info messages
  * User sessions
  * Errors
  * Locks
  * Java VM Info
  * Scheduler

## Info messages:

Here you can create an info message in the OLAT HTML Editor which appears on
the login page next to the login access area. There is also a separate area
for maintenance messages. This information, which appears on all OLAT pages,
can also be created in the OLAT Editor. In addition, documents (e.g. further
information in pdf form) can be linked. A "static folder" is available for
this purpose.
