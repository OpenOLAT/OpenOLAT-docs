## Info messages {: #info_message}

Here you can create an info message in the OpenOlat HTML editor which appears on the **login page** next to the login access area.

There is also a separate area for **maintenance messages**. This information, which appears on all OpenOlat pages, can also be created in the OpenOlat Editor.

In addition, documents (e.g. further information in pdf form) can be linked. A "static folder" is available for this purpose.
