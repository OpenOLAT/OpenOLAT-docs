# eAssessment: ePortfolio

The administrator can switch ePortfolio 2.0 on or off in the `eAssessment â†’ ePortfolio` area.

Furthermore it is defined to what extend the learners can create their own binders and if they can access portfolio templates. The extent of individual use is therefore defined here independently of teachers or teaching processes.

Also the visibility of different portfolio elements like "Overview", "Entries", "History", "Search", "Timeline" and "Comments" can be activated or deactivated.

If you deactivate an ePortfolio module in an ongoing course only its
functionalities will no longer be visible in the GUI. All artefacts and
folders will still be available.

In order for users to be able to use the taxonomy(ies) in the [ePortfolio](../../manual_user/area_modules/Competences_tags.md), they must be activated by the OpenOlat administrator.

If the ePortfolio module is switched off during operation, only the functionalities are no longer visible in the GUI. However, all entries and folders are retained.
