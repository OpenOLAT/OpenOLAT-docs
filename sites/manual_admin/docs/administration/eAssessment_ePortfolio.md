# eAssessment: ePortfolio

In this form the OpenOlat administrator can activate / deactivate the
ePortfolio 2.0.

Furthermore it is defined to what extend the learners can create their own
binders and if they can access portfolio templates. Also the visibility of
different portfolio elements like "Overview", "Entries", "History", "Search",
"Timeline" and "Comments" can be activated or deactivated.

If you deactivate an ePortfolio module in an ongoing course only its
functionalities will no longer be visible in the GUI. All artefacts and
folders will still be available.

!!! info
	The old ePortfolio 1.0 is no longer supported as of OpenOlat version 15.
