# Projects

:octicons-tag-24: Release 18.0

Projects are switched on and created.

## Authorizations

You can set whether certain user roles can create projects & templates. Either all (including members) or role-specific.

## Project members

The project members are usually made project members by the project manager. (As a rule, the project manager is the person who creates the new project).

As soon as a project member is registered, they receive a link. After clicking on the link, a wizard guides the new project member through the login and registration process.

## External members

If people who are not registered as users in OpenOlat are also to work on the project, they can be invited as external members.

!!! info "Note"

    "External member" is not a role. An external member can have all roles except owner and course owner (roles that can be used to delete the entire project).

There are also roles that can operate across several projects:

**Project manager**

The project administrator can see, update and manage all projects including the members. But cannot see their content. In addition to the owner and the administrator, he is the person who can assign the management role to others. They have access to the "Administration" tab in the Projects area.

**Administrator**

The system-wide role of administrator only has restricted access to projects. Administrators only have access to a project if they are also a member of the project. Administrators can make themselves a member, but this is then logged. This is intended to curb abusive access.
