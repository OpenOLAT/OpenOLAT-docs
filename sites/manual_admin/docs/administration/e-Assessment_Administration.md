## Coaching

Here, the coaching module is activated.

## Certificates

An e-mail address can be stored here to which copies of the certificates
created can be sent. Copies to line managers are also possible. The upload of external certificates can also be enabled here. In addition, this function is also available for user administrators, line managers in the same organization or for responsible persons who are connected via a user-to-user relationship and can be configured separately in each case.


## Assessment management

At this point, administrators can basically enable assessment mode for the OpenOlat instance and search for assessments.

## Test

This is where the test receipt is configured and settings for the correction flow of tests are defined. You can use the correction workflow to generate personal correction orders and assign them to defined correctors. Correction via the assessment tool in the course is then no longer possible.
