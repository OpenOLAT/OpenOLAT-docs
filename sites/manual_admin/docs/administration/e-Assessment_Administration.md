## Coaching

Here the coaching module is activated.

## Assessment mode

At this point, administrators can basically enable assessment mode for the
OpenOlat instance and search for assessments.

## Certificates

An e-mail address can be stored here to which copies of the certificates
created can be sent. Copies to line managers are also possible. The upload of external certificates can also be enabled here. In addition, this function is also available for user administrators, line managers in the same organization or for responsible persons who are connected via a user-to-user relationship and can be configured separately in each case.

## Grading

Here, the correction workflow for external correctors with access via the
Coaching Tool can be activated system-wide and the visibility for certain
system roles can be defined.
