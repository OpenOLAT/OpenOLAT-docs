## Coaching

Here the coaching module is activated.

## Assessment mode

At this point, administrators can basically enable assessment mode for the
OpenOlat instance and search for assessments.

## Certificates

An e-mail address can be stored here to which copies of the certificates
created can be sent. Copies to line managers are also possible.

## Grading

Here, the correction workflow for external correctors with access via the
Coaching Tool can be activated system-wide and the visibility for certain
system roles can be defined.
