## Allow leaving courses {: #allow_leaving_courses}

This option specifies a default setting for all new courses. (Existing courses are not affected by this.) Course participants can then decide for themselves whether they want to leave a course. This means that they can terminate their membership of a course themselves and unsubscribe as a course member.

The setting can be adjusted by course owners in the course under **(Course) Administration > Settings > Sharing tab** on a course-specific basis.

## Notification {: #notification}

OpenOlat can send notifications about events at various points. If someone wants to receive the notifications, a subscription can be set up.

Notifications about events in the repository currently (Release 19) only affect the subscription item "**Notify owners about status changes for learning resources**".

A) Default setting<br>
Activating/deactivating the subscription determines whether a subscription for the described target group is also set up by default when a new course or learning resource is created in the repository.

B) Existing subscriptions can be updated using the "Activate existing subscriptions" and "Deactivate existing subscriptions" buttons.
