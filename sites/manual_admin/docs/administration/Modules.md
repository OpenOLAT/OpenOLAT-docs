## Instant messaging

Here the OpenOlat chat and instant massaging can be activated or deactivated
and further detailed settings can be made. For example you can decide if the
chat function in groups and courses is available or if anonymous chat posts
are possible.

## Wiki

 **Block Wiki resource** : Wiki configuration: Disable the option "Enable Wiki
resource" to block the Wiki system-wide. The Wiki component is currently still
vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks (XSS). Therefore the XSS scanner
can be activated additionally. This can lead to impairments in the Wiki
functionality in OpenOlat. If the XSS scanner is switched off, the Wiki can be
used with the risk of an XSS attack. However, the Wiki component has automatic
versioning, which makes it difficult for attackers to remain undetected.

## Semester dates

Create and manage semester dates to be able to refer to a semester designation
instead of a date for course durations. The semester data created here can be
used when configuring the execution period of a course in learning resource
management. For example, "SoSe22" could be used as the designation and "Summer
semester 2022" as the name.

## Groups

Here you can define if course authors and learners are allowed to create new
groups. Possible rights for group administrators and learning resource
administrators in the group context can also be defined. In order to meet data
protection requirements, it can be defined whether an e-mail must be sent when
inviting users to courses and groups and whether the invitation results in
direct membership or must first be confirmed by the invited user.
Administrators can also purge course and group members here.

## Forum

Administrators can define here if pseudonymous forum posts are allowed and
also define the appropriate default configuration for forums.

## Course

In the "Settings" tab, the default type for OpenOlat courses, learning path or
traditional course, can be defined. Settings for assessable course elements
can also be made here. In the tab "Didactic Types" new didactic types can be
defined and existing ones can be edited or deleted. Categories for color
categories with CSS classes and style images can also be added here.
