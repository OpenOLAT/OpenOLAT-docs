## Instant Messaging
See [Instant-Messaging](Instant_Messaging.md)

## Video 
Hier können die Lernressource Video und der Kursbaustein Video aktiviert werden. Auch Angaben zum Transkodierung sowie die Standardauflösung können definiert werden.   

## Contact Tracing
See [Contact tracing](Modules_Contact_Tracing.md)

## Wiki

 **Block Wiki resource** : Wiki configuration: Disable the option "Enable Wiki
resource" to block the Wiki system-wide. The Wiki component is currently still
vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks (XSS). Therefore the XSS scanner
can be activated additionally. This can lead to impairments in the Wiki
functionality in OpenOlat. If the XSS scanner is switched off, the Wiki can be
used with the risk of an XSS attack. However, the Wiki component has automatic
versioning, which makes it difficult for attackers to remain undetected.

## Course reminders 

Activation of course reminders and setting the sending frequency.

## Audio/Video recording

Activation of the video recording option at various points in OpenOlat. Local transcoding can also be activated.

See [Audio/video recording](Modules_Audio_Video_Recording.md)

## Covid certificate

Activation of the COVID certificate with further settings such as validity period, reminder settings, scan settings for the certificate.

## Document pool
See [Document pool](Modules_Document_pool.md)

## Livestream

## Taxonomy
See [Taxonomy](Modules_Taxonomy.md)

## Semester terms

Create and manage semester dates to be able to refer to a semester designation
instead of a date for course durations. The semester data created here can be
used when configuring the execution period of a course in learning resource
management. For example, "SoSe23" could be used as the designation and "Summer
semester 2023" as the name.

## Media Center

Here you can define whether or which taxonomy should be connected to the Media Center.

See [Media Center](Modules_Media_Center.md)

## Data privacy

## Bookings

Display of all bookings for a booking number in a specified period

## Groups

Here you can define if course authors and learners are allowed to create new
groups. Possible rights for group administrators and learning resource
administrators in the group context can also be defined. In order to meet data
protection requirements, it can be defined whether an e-mail must be sent when
inviting users to courses and groups and whether the invitation results in
direct membership or must first be confirmed by the invited user.
Administrators can also purge course and group members here.

## Lectures
See [Lectures](Lecture_and_roll_call_management.md)

## Library

Activate the "Library" menu and select the corresponding resource folder.

## Forum

Administrators can define here, if pseudonymous forum posts are allowed and
also define the appropriate default configuration for forums.

## Course

In the "Settings" tab, the default type for OpenOlat courses, learning path or
traditional course, can be defined. Settings for assessable course elements
can also be made here. In the tab "Didactic Types" new didactic types can be
defined and existing ones can be edited or deleted. Categories for color
categories with CSS classes and style images can also be added here.
