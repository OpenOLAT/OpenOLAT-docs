## Sites

Here you define which OpenOlat areas are made available system-wide and which
rights and role groups are granted access to each area.

If guests are to have access to courses either "Catalog" or "My Courses
(including Catalog)" has to be activated for guests.

If courses that are accessible for guests are to appear in the catalog, these
courses have to be added to the catalog. This can be done by the course owner,
the catalog administrator or the system administrator.
