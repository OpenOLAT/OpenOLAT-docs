## Language adaptation tool

Individual text elements can be adjusted here if required.

## Portal

Settings for the tab "Home"

## Sites

Here you define which OpenOlat areas are made available system-wide and which

If guests are to have access to courses either "Catalog" or "My Courses

If courses that are accessible for guests are to appear in the catalog, these
courses have to be added to the catalog. This can be done by the course owner,
the catalog administrator or the system administrator.
