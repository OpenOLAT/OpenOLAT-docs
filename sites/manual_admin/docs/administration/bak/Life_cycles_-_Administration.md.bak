## Automatic life cycle management

Similar to the automatically controlled course lifecycle, the lifecycle of
OpenOlat users can also be automated. In a first step, the accounts of users
who have not been active for a longer period of time can thus first be
deactivated and the user status set to "inactive". If no new login takes place
within the specified period, the user account is deleted. Depending on the
configuration, users can receive an e-mail with a corresponding note before or
after the account is deactivated or deleted.

## Groups

In OpenOlat Administration, settings can be made for both the group life cycle
and the user cycle. It is also possible to select certain group types and
restrict the inactivation to these groups only. Basically, the life cycle can
be defined in terms of inactivation, deletion and irrevocable deletion.

## Users

Here the concrete different text notifications in the context of account
deactivation can be formulated and the time of mail notification can be
defined. Furthermore, it can be defined whether inactive users should be
deleted.
