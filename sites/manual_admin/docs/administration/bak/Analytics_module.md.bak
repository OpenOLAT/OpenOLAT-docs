#  [Analytics module](Analytics+module.html)

In OpenOlat the infrastructure to support external analytics tools is built.
Therewith a detailed analysis of user behavior or the applied equipment while
using OpenOlat is possible.

For the initial implementation only a provider to Google Analytics is
implemented. To use the tool you need a Google Analytics account and create a
Tracking-ID for your OpenOlat installation. This ID can be configured in the
admin environment in the "external tools" section.

Once configured, Google Analytics will show for example

  * where your users spend most of the time,
  * which browsers they use,
  * if they are on a smartphone.

It also offers "real-time" analysis.
