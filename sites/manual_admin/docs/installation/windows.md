# Install OpenOlat on Microsoft Windows

## On the server

_Microsoft Window is not supported on the server side!_ 

Of course you can install Java and Tomcat, however there are code elements known not to work on Windows operating systems mostly due to the file system separator: Windows uses back-slashes `\` while the rest of the world uses forward slashes `/`. OpenOlat is optimized for the rest of the world, sorry. 


## On the client

On the client all operation systems are supported that have a modern browser such as Chrome, Edge, Safari and others. OpenOlat has a responsive design, all features are supported in mobile and desktop browsers.
