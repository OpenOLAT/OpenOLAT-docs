# Configure User {: #user_configuration} 

If you have the right to manage users, you can search for a specific person using the user search and make further configurations for them.

The mandatory entries in the user profile include: Login name, first name, surname and e-mail address. If the sending of emails to this address is to be prevented, this email address can be blocked.
