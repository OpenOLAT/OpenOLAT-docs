# Assign roles

As soon as a user has been created and an account has been set up, it can be
further configured. An important setting is the assignment of the desired
role(s).

As the user administrator, go to the user search and select the desired
person. This takes you to the user settings. Various tabs are available here.
Select "[Roles](../../manual_user/access_roles_rights/index.md)" and assign the desired role.
