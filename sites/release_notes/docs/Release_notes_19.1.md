Various **extensions in the peer review process** in the "Task" course element support participants and coaches even better in conducting and administering reviews. For the course element **"Topic broker"**, among other things, the execution of **enrollments** has been optimized. The **redesign of the subscription function** on course elements and in the project tool provides a better overview.

From now on, the **completion criterion** of course elements can also be used as a condition for the allocation of **OpenBadges** in the learning path. The improved wizard guides authors conveniently from the creation to the final configuration of the badges.

Overall, a strong focus was placed on **security** and **improved accessibility**, numerous adjustments in the area of **"UX and usability"** and optimizations, such as for File Hub, Media Center and Project Tool, complete this release.

## New course element "Selection"

!!! info "Note"

    This function is only available for learning path courses.

With the new selection course element, it is possible to offer several work assignments, of which the participants only have to complete a specified number ("x out of y").

Authors can use all course elements for the work assignments, subordinate them to the selection course element and define how many of them must be processed and completed by the participants.

Participants receive an overview of all available work assignments in the selection course element. For each topic, they can view further details such as description, learning objectives and processing instructions in the preview and then select the ones they want to work on.

Selected work assignments appear in the learning path navigation below the selected course element and are mandatory for participants. The results of the individual work assignments are included in the overall assessment of the course.

The processing status of the participants can be seen by coaches in the overview on the selection course element.
