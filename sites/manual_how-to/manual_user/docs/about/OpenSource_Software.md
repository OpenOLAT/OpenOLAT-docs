# The Idea of Open-Source Software

OpenOlat is an open-source software which means that its code is at your
disposal for free. You can download it, use it, adapt it, and develop it
further without having to pay license fees. Further information on this open-
source project can be found on our community website
[www.openolat.org](http://www.openolat.org). There you can get in contact with
the open-source community, put your name down in the mailing list, and
exchange experiences.

Why open source? There are two reasons: first the OpenOlat team benefits from
the software's world-wide operation; various institutions and companies
provide us with valuable input for OpenOlat's further development. The second
reason is the fact that thanks to translators from the open-source community
we are able to offer this software in numerous languages by now.
