# Creating CP Learning Content

This chapter explains course authors how to create Content Packagings.
Additionally, you will find information on how to embed your CPs in courses
and explains the features of the CP editor.

CP stands for "Content Packaging" and is an e-learning standard for learning
content. A content packaging is a self-contained learning content in a
standardized e-learning format, for example an online module for your subject
area. When creating your learning content as CP you can use it not only within
OpenOlat but in other learning platforms that support this CP format as well.

CPs in OpenOlat are usually embedded in a course. It is possible to use the
same CP in several courses. For example, you can use an introductory module
not only within a course for beginners but also as starting point in a more
advanced course. If you have not created any courses yet you will get some
guidance in the chapter ["Creating courses"](../course_create/index.de.md) before
creating your CP by means of the following instruction.

If you want to create large learning contents we recommend using
[eLML](http://www.elml.org "eLML.org").
