![survey icon](assets/formular_434343_64.png)

With the course element "Survey" you can add an online questionnaire to your
course. Als Basis wird die Lernressource "Formular" verwendet und mit dem Kursbaustein Umfrage verkn√ºpft. 
A questionnaire must
first be created with the learning resource "Form" in the author area. If you
have not yet created a questionnaire, follow the instructions in chapter "[3 steps to your questionnaire](../forms/Three_Steps_to_your_Form.md)". By default, the results are stored anonymously. 

A formular linked in a course can only be edited completely in the formular
editor as long as the page has not been opened. After that only typing errors
can be corrected.

!!! Note 

    If participants are currently running the questionnaire but have not yet completed it, their results will be lost.

Further information on the subject of questionnaires and surveys can be found
in the chapter "[Creating questionnaires](../forms/Form_editor_Questionnaire_editor.md)" and
the corresponding subchapters.
