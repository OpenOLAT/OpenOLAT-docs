### Step 2:

Create a new certificate program using the button at the top right.

![certification_programs_settings_config_step2_v1_de.png](assets/certification_programs_settings_config_step2_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

Then start with the setup, preferably here:<br>
**Course Planner > Certificate program > Select certificate program from list > Tab "Settings" > Button "Configuration"**

### Step 3: Period of validity

Would you like the issued certificate to have a limited period of validity?

* If not, the "Validity" toggle button can remain off. 
(The certificate will then be valid indefinitely.)
* If you want to limit the validity, activate the toggle button. In this case, specify the validity period in days.

### Step 4: Recertification
The recertification option can only be selected once a validity period has been specified.

If recertification is desired, specify a time window for recertification. This determines how long participants have to renew their certificate after it has expired.

### Step 5: Credit points for recertification?

If recertification has been activated, another toggle button can be used to decide whether credit points are required for recertification. If desired, please provide the following information:

* Should the recertification be triggered automatically or manually?
* Which credit point system should be used?
* How many credit points are required to acquire a certificate?
* Is an early recertification by the participant possible? (Participants can then renew their certificate early, even if the certificate is still valid.)

Now use the "Certificate" button to specify which PDF certificate will be sent.
Select the appropriate template.

### Step 7: Metadata

In the metadata, you can specify the title and identifier of the program and restrict administrative access to specific organizational units.

### Step 8: Add implementation

The condition for obtaining a certificate is the successful completion of one of the implementations listed here (OR link, one of the implementations listed here is sufficient).
So add a feed-through using the button at the top right.

If you wish to specify multiple implementations, please note:<br>
It does not matter whether there are several versions of exactly the same product or course. Therefore, the selection must be made carefully to ensure equivalence.

### Step 9: Add members and owners

Once all the terms and conditions of the certificate have been clarified, you can specify the people who are to receive it in the "Members" tab.

If you want another person to be able to edit this certificate program, add that person in the "Owners" tab.

## Use case 1: Data protection certificates with credit points  {: #use_case_1}

* Certificates must be updated regularly within the company.
* With OpenOlat, associates automatically earn credit points when they complete training courses.
* Once a certain number of points has been reached, the certificate is automatically renewed.
* No manual follow-up by supervisors is required.

---


## Use case 2: Training programs with automatic recertification {: #use_case_2}

* In educational institutions, learners accumulate points across several modules, which lead to a certificate of completion.
* Once this certificate expires, it can be renewed automatically or manually as soon as new points are added.
* This system is designed to encourage continuous learning.

## Use case 3: Leadership development with flexible learning paths  {: #use_case_3}

* Managers complete various learning modules and collect skill points in the process.
* Once they reach the threshold, their certificate is automatically renewed.
* If desired, renewal can also be carried out manually, so that the institution retains control at all times.
