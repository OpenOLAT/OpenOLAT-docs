## A) Selection of a course element as a coach {: #by_course_element}

If you call up a course in the role of coach, you will see a different view than the participants after selecting an assessable course element in the course menu.

By clicking on the name of a participant (via the "Overview" or "Participants" tab), you can go directly to the results of the participant in this course element.

## B) Assessment tool {: #by_assessment_tool}

If you are not only interested in a single course element, but would like to get an overview of the performance of the entire course, the most important tool for coaches is the [Assessment tool ](../../manual_user/learningresources/Assessment_tool_overview.md). You can find it under Administration.

## C) Learning path tool {: #by_learning_path_tool}

!!! info "Note"

    The "Learning path" icon is only displayed in the toolbar if you are in a [Learning path course](../../manual_user/learningresources/Learning_path_course.md).


When a participant accesses the learning path tool, only their own results are visible. As a coach, you have access to the learning path information of all the participants you coach.

## D) Automatic reminders {: #by_reminders}

The [reminder function](../../manual_user/learningresources/Course_Reminders.md) is mostly used to send e-mails to participants. However, it can also be used to inform coaches.

![course_reminder_access_v1_de.png](assets/course_reminder_access_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

**Example 1: Automatic mails to course participants, cc to coaches**<br>

In the last step of creating/editing a reminder, it is possible to add coaches to the group of recipients (defined by rules).

![course_reminder_cc_coach_v1_de.png](assets/course_reminder_cc_coach_v1_de.png){ class="shadow lightbox" }

**Example 2: Automatic mail only to coach**<br>

A reminder that would be sent to certain recipients according to defined rules can also only be sent to coaches for information. 

For example, a reminder could be sent to those participants who have never accessed the course 2 weeks after the start of the course. The rules for this reminder are chosen so that the recipients are the somewhat negligent participants. In the last step of the reminder creation, however, "Only to specific recipients" is selected and "Responsible coaches" is selected. The information about the course not yet attended is then only sent to the coaches.

!!! tip "Hint"

    Variables can also be used in the text of the reminder e-mails. (See [Variables in the e-mail text of reminders](../../manual_user/learningresources/Course_Reminders.md).) Various variables are available to distinguish between the recipients who were originally contacted and the (alternatively) informed coaches:

    $FirstName<br>
    $LastName<br>
    $recipientFirstName<br>
    $recipientLastName
