## Which badges can I award? {: #description}

Basically 3 categories of badges can be awarded:

* **Badges for a course**<br> (for passing the course or fulfilling the conditions set there)
* **Badges for a specific course element**<br> (like course badges, with a condition for a specific course element)
* and **global badges**<br> (cross-course, can only be created by administrators)

## Conditions for awarding badges {: #conditions}

### General activation of badges {: #activation_general}

As a general prerequisite for the availability of badges

* the assignment option for the entire instance must have been activated by administrators
* and a [matching badge created](../badges/badges.md).


### Activaton of badges in a course {: #activation_course}

Course authors can determine when and which badge their course participants receive. 

If badges are generally activated, the possibility of awarding badges can be activated for each course under<br>

You can also specify whether manual allocation by course owners and supervisors should be possible.
