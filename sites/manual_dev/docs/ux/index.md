# UX Guidelines

These guidelines are for interface designers and software developers (us) working on our product to document and contain a more consistent interface and experience within OpenOlat.

In this section you will find a site for every **Component** (a group of website elements that we us regularly) and **Design Patterns** for more of the broader usecases in our product.
