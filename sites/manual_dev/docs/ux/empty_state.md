## Empty Search State Variant

An Empty search results empty state serves as a placeholder when there are no search results after doing a search or filtering results. It should describe that a search or filter came back with no results and does not contain a Primary or Secondar Action.

## When to use

Empty states always appear in the otherwise empty space, in the context of the data thatâ€™s missing. They can occur anywhere your app can display data, including but not limited to dashboards and tables.

When space is limited, use text only.
