The secondary button has more emphasis then a text button. Mostly used for secondary important actions beside a primary button to highlight a hierarchy.

<span style="color: crimson;">In Development. Only Proposal</span>.

Other than a Text link inside a text, this is a standalone element, used for tertiary elements.

#### Text Button

Currently the Text Button functions as unobtrusive Idea for a place, where alot of functions are already there and has the least importance.


#### Disabled Button

This is an example of a disabled button. The disabled property is added on submit to prevents people from submitting their information twice by mistake while submitting a form.

### Structure

Buttons can have various sizes.
XS / S / SM / M / L

## Guidelines

### A single, primary button

As a general rule, a layout should contain a single primary button that makes it clear that other buttons have less importance in the hierarchy. This primary button commands the most attention.

### Button Groups

| Alignment    | Use case|
|--------------|-----------
| *Left-justified*	 |  TBD    |
| *Right-justified*     | 	Inline notifications, inline field buttons and data tables, forms, wizards, and single-button dialogs |
| *Full-width*	     | Dialogs, and small pop-ups, where only 1 or 2 actions are necessary  |

When using multiple buttons, the position of the primary button is the most important part. To sum up, a primary button will be left-aligned and positioned to the left of the secondary/tertiary button.

If the Model is right aligned, the primary button will be right-aligned and appear to the right of the secondary/tertiary button.
