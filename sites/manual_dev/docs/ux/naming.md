# Naming conventions

We have many resources, objects, input fields in OpenOlat. Naming them in a similar manner to add comparability to our System, we envelop some conventions in naming similar objects the same way.

## Name & Identifier

Every Object, that is generic be created and shared, should have an **Name**, the Display name and an **Identifier** to distinct identical objects from different executions. Currently this can be applied to Learning ressources, Curriculum elements, taxonomy elements.

Name should be the first entry, followed by identifier.

### Name
Is the display name of the object and not unique.

_Deutsch_: Name , _Francais_: Nom

### Identifier
To distinct similar sounding objects, you can add an identifier.

_Deutsch_: Kennzeichen , _Francais_: signe de reconnaissance
