### Menu Button

There are two different types of menu buttons. Both can contain items with submenus.

#### Regular Menu Button

When the user activates the button, the menu opens. This is the default type.

#### Split Menu Button

The split menu button is separated into two areas: the text label and the icon. The separator between them signals that the two areas result in different actions. The user can either trigger the action, by clicking on the text label or click on the arrow opens the menu. 

The split button groups a variety of actions and commands. The most used action is displayed as the text label.
