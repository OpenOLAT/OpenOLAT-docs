A Variant currently in use in Catalog only. Smaller with less information (minus: course progress, duration, place).

## Guidelines / Usage

### When to use

Display a single, concise group of content within a set of similar, related content. For example a list of courses, different groups.

### When _not_ to use

If we need a high information density or you need to compare data, the table view is a better choice.

### Alignment

Except for Buttons and the personal learning progress the content is right aligned.

### Accessibility
