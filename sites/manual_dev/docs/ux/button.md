Currently the Text Button functions as unobtrusive Idea for a place, where alot of functions are already there and has the least importance.

## Structure

Buttons can have various sizes.
XS / S / SM / M / L

## Guidelines / Usage

| Button type    | Use case|
|--------------|-----------
|Primary Button | Most important action on the page/section. A layout should contain a single primary button that makes it clear that other buttons have less importance in the hierarchy. |
| Secondary Button / Default | Default Button for all other actions, that are available or less important than the primary |
| Ghost Button | For the tertiary actions, who are less important or could stick out to much. |
| Text Link | Only for linking between the different pages / sections (not technically a button) |

### Navigation
Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Button Groups

| Alignment    | Use case|
|--------------|-----------
| *Right-justified*     | Inline notifications, inline field buttons and data tables, forms, wizards, and single-button dialogs |
| *Full-width*    | Dialogs, and small pop-ups, where only 1 or 2 actions are necessary  |

When using multiple buttons, the position of the primary button is the most important part. To sum up, a primary button will be left-aligned and positioned to the left of the secondary/tertiary button.
