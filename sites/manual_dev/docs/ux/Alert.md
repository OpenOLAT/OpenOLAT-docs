Inline Notifications are info messages, who we want the user to read, before taking an action. Today they are not dismissible in general.

## Guidelines / Usage

### When to use

Advise the user that they should be aware of, or address something related to their current context.
Reaffirm to the user that an done action has been successful.
Educate the user about new or unused feature, or information related to their current context.


### When _not_ to use

If you are immediately confirming a user's action while they remain in the same view, use a form confirmation instead.
For a message at an instance level message from an admin to all users, use a maintenance message.
