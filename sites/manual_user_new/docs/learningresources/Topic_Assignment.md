#  Managing Topics of Topic Assignments

The course element "Topic assignment" is used within an OpenOlat course. A
course author can configure this element as needed and appoint persons
responsible for a topic. Persons responsible for topics can offer their course
participants a variety of topics before managing these participants along with
their topics. Course participants will be able to submit expositions via drop
boxes. Corrections can then be returned via return boxes.
