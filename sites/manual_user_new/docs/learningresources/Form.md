Since OpenOlat version 15.5 the learning resource "Form" is available. It replaces the previous learning resource "Survey" and can be used in the course as a basis for the course elements "Survey" and "Form". Furthermore, this learning resource is the basis for the rubric form of the course element "[Assessment](../course_elements/Course_Element_Assessment.md)" and the basis for the form of the portfolio task of the type form.

This chapter explains how OpenOlat authors can create forms, which possibilities the form editor provides, how to use forms and questionnaires created with them in courses and which options are available for assessment and result provision.
