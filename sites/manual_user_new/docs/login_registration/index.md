In order to work with OpenOlat you need an internet connection as well as a
[browser](Login_Page.md#LoginPage-login_browsercheck). The kind of the first
registration as well as the concrete procedure varies depending of the

corresponding OpenOlat login page. In the case of dubieties or queries please
contact the local OpenOlat support of your organization. Concerning your first
OpenOlat registration, please contact the manager responsible for e-learning
in your organization.

After successful registration you will be directed to the systemwide landing
page, which can differ between systems and also between OpenOlat authors and
users. Further information on how to set your personal landing can be found in
[Settings](../personal/Configuration.md#Configuration-_einstellungen).
